35314979,"Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide and a functional component in foods, while also showing health-promoting effects. Generally, food-derived carnosine is quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We have developed a method for quantifying carnosine in foods using microbial enzymes, β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase (BapA) and histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL). The carnosine concentrations in extracts of chicken, pork, beef, bonito, and tuna were determined via both HPLC and enzymatic determination. The carnosine contents measured via enzymatic determination were in agreement with those determined via conventional HPLC analysis. Relative standard-deviation values of the conventional HPLC method and the enzymatic determination of carnosine in foods were 0.728-5.76% and 0.504-4.58%, respectively. The recovery of carnosine in food extracts via enzymatic determination was 97-103%. Therefore, the developed enzymatic determination technique using BapA and HAL can be used for the determination of carnosine in meats and fishes with comparable accuracy to that of conventional HPLC analysis.",Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002336', 'D002417', 'D004150', 'D005399', 'D006638', 'D008460', 'D016958']","['Animals', 'Carnosine', 'Cattle', 'Dipeptidases', 'Fishes', 'Histidine Ammonia-Lyase', 'Meat', 'Pseudomonas putida']",Enzymatic determination of carnosine in meat and fish using β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase and histidine ammonia-lyase derived from Pseudomonas putida NBRC100650.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35314979,2022
35106614,"Analysis of the dipicolinic acid (DPA) released from Clostridium botulinum spores during thermal processing is crucial to obtaining a mechanistic understanding of the factors involved in spore heat resistance and related food safety applications. Here, we developed a novel mixed-mode liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for detection of the DPA released from C. botulinum type A, nonproteolytic types B and F strains, and nonpathogenic surrogate Clostridium sporogenes PA3679 spores. DPA was retained on a mixed-mode C18/anion exchange column and was detected using electrospray ionization (ESI) positive mode within a 4-min analysis time. The intraday and interday precision (%CV) was 1.94-3.46% and 4.04-8.28%, respectively. Matrix effects were minimal across proteolytic type A Giorgio-A, nonproteolytic types QC-B and 202-F, and C. sporogenes PA3679 spore suspensions (90.1-114% of spiked DPA concentrations). DPA recovery in carrot juice and beef broth ranged from 105 to 118%, indicating limited matrix effects of these food products. Experiments that assessed the DPA released from Giorgio-A spores over the course of a 5-min thermal treatment at 108 °C found a significant correlation (R = 0.907; P < 0.05) between the log reduction of spores and amount of DPA released. This mixed-mode LC-MS/MS method provides a means for rapid detection of DPA released from C. botulinum spores during thermal processing and has the potential to be used for experiments in the field of food safety that assess the thermal resistance characteristics of various C. botulinum spore types.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,[],[],Rapid detection and quantitation of dipicolinic acid from Clostridium botulinum spores using mixed-mode liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35106614,2022
34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases.

In this study, mepiquat formation in meat (pork and beef) and vegetables (potatoes and broccoli) was investigated via HPLC-MS/MS; the investigated cooking methods were oven baking, pan cooking, deep frying, and microwaving. The results showed that, among all foods, oven-baked potatoes showed the highest mepiquat level of 1064 μg/kg, which appeared after 20 min at 240 °C. The residual rates of mepiquat precursors, pipecolic acid (PipAc), betaine, choline, and trigonelline, were determined in oven-baked potatoes to investigate their correlation with mepiquat formation. The PipAc levels reduced by 99.8% at 260 °C after 30 min of oven baking, exhibiting a significantly high decomposition rate.

34677016,"As among the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, plant growth regulators (PGRs) have a positive influence on plants. However, the overuse of PGRs may induce toxicity in food and even be hazardous to human health. Numerous studies have investigated the presence and residues of PGRs on vegetables and fruits. Animal-derived foods are one of the most dominant food sources providing nutrients to fulfil the daily dietary intake, and could also be potentially contaminated by PGRs. However, there is little information on PGR residues in animal-derived foods. Standardization also lacks among the techniques for PGR determination in animal-derived foods, thereby restricting the further establishment of pesticide usage and food safety regulations. Therefore, in this study, a rapid and effective method for analyzing chlormequat chloride, thidiazuron, and paclobutrazol in animal-derived food samples was established. The method primarily involves high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with the use of isotope-labeled internal standards.

As food anti-microbials, the compounds will have to withstand the cooking process without changing to toxic compounds. With this Communication, we address the question of whether PEA and EAA are altered when heated to 73.9 °C or 93.3 °C. A combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to analyze solutions of PEA(-HCl) or EAA in beef broth or water. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA was compared between heated and unheated samples at a range of concentrations. The gas chromatograms of PEA(-HCl) and EAA showed one peak at early retention times that did not differ between the heated and unheated samples. The mass spectra for PEA and EAA were near identical to those from a spectral database and did not show any differences between the heated and unheated samples. We conclude that PEA(-HCl) and EAA formed pure solutions and were not altered during the heating process. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA did not change after the heating of the compounds.

33719440,"Food authenticity and safety are major public concerns due to the increasing number of food fraud cases. Meat fraud is an economically motivated practice of covertly replacing one type of meat with a cheaper alternative raising health, safety, and ethical concerns for consumers. In this study, we implement the MasSpec Pen technology for rapid and direct meat analysis and authentication. The MasSpec Pen is an easy-to-use handheld device connected to a mass spectrometer that employs a solvent droplet for gentle chemical analysis of samples. Here, MasSpec Pen analysis was performed directly on several meat and fish types including grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef, venison, cod, halibut, Atlantic salmon, sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout, with a total analysis time of 15 s per sample. Statistical models developed with the Lasso method using a training set of samples yielded per-sample accuracies of 95% for the beef model, 100% for the beef versus venison model, and 84% for the multiclass fish model. Predictors of meat type selected included several molecules previously reported in the skeletal muscles of animals, including carnosine, anserine, succinic acid, xanthine, and taurine. When testing the models on independent test sets of samples, per-sample accuracies of 100% were achieved for all models, demonstrating the robustness of our method for unadulterated meat authentication. MasSpec Pen feasibility testing for classifying venison and grass-fed beef samples adulterated with grain-fed beef achieved per-sample prediction accuracies of 100% for both classifiers using test sets of samples. Altogether, the results obtained in this study provide compelling evidence that the MasSpec Pen technology is a powerful alternative analytical method for meat analysis and investigation of meat fraud.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002523', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D012474', 'D013672']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Edible Grain', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Salmon', 'Technology']",Rapid Analysis and Authentication of Meat Using the MasSpec Pen Technology.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719440,2021

However, its presence in animal source food products sold in the Guangdong Province (GD) of China, and the resultant dietary exposure have not been elucidated. To address this gap, 3,100 samples from seven food categories, including beef, pork, mutton, offals, broilers, hen eggs, and farmed freshwater fish, marketed throughout four geographical regions of GD, were collected from 2015 to 2018. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to detect PCP levels in these food matrices. PCP was found in all food categories, but the average contamination levels were low, ranging from 0.40 µg/kg wet weight (ww) (hen eggs) to 5.85 µg/kg ww (offals). However, higher concentrations of PCP were detected (P < 0.05) in animal source food from the North region. Additionally, a temporal declining trend was observed in this four-year consecutive survey. The estimated human dietary exposure of PCP to population groups, including the general population and subgroups (male and female, children, and adults), was found to be far below the permissible daily intake (3 µg/kg body weight). Therefore, the health impacts of PCP should be correspondingly low for local residents, based on current toxicological knowledge.

Five PFIs occurring between 2016 and 2018 involved 7 food products including 2 food types, jerky treats or canned food, made from beef or bison. The dogs' serum thyroid hormone concentrations were evaluated before and after diet change. The foods were tested for active thyroid hormones and hormone precursors using high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detection. The foods were also examined microscopically. Serum thyroid hormone concentrations of thyroxine (T4) varied depending on the food type consumed. Dogs that consumed dried jerky containing greater T4 concentrations often had increased serum T4 concentrations, whereas dogs that consumed canned products containing greater and 3,4,5- and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations often had decreased serum T4 concentrations.

This study aimed to determine the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of the digested game meats (venison and boar meat) compared with those of livestock meats (beef and pork). Through the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size chromatography results, we found that the digested products from each meat had different molecular weights. The ACE inhibitory ratio in all tested samples had gradually increased following by the enzyme treatments. ACE inhibitory ratios and the half maximal inhibitory concentration values indicated that digested venison was the most potent inhibitor of ACE activity, followed by the digested boar meat. The level of anserine in digested venison was higher than that in the other meats, but the carnosine level was lower. Through fractionations and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, five ACE inhibitory peptides were identified from the digested venison. Of these peptides, Isoleucine-Lysine- Glutamic Acid-Valine-Threonine-Glutamic Acid-Arginine (IKEVTER) demonstrated the highest ACE inhibitory activity. Therefore, the game meat is food that is believed potentially to offer high bioactivities, particularly antihypertensive forces.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],"Isolation, Evaluation, and Identification of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides from Game Meat.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854180,2020

Four groups of HAs were detected and quantified in both free and protein-bound states: imidazopyridines (DMIP, 1,5,6-TMIP), imidazoquinolines (MeIQ), imidazoquinoxalines (IQx, 4,8-MeIQx) and β-carbolines (norharman, harman). Notably, different amounts of added capsaicin, sanshoamide and piperine had significant inhibitory effects on free DMIP, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx and harman formation in roast beef patties. Additionally, all three amide components significantly inhibited the formation of protein-bound MeIQ, 4,8-DiMeIQx, harman, norharman and MeAαC.

To assess to what extent beef and dairy farms represent a source of hormones to the aquatic environment, surface water runoff samples from three beef and dairy farms that utilize best manure management practices were evaluated for hormone concentrations (estrogens, androgens, progestogens) and estrogenic activity. Runoff was collected from weirs at the edge of each of six study fields from March 2008 to March 2010 and was analyzed for hormone concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and for estrogenic activity using the E-screen bioassay. The majority of runoff events occurred in February and March when the soil was frozen. Progesterone and 4-androstenedione were the most frequently detected hormones (63% and 50%, respectively) and occurred at event loads up to 49,000 μg/ha and 26,000 μg/ha, respectively. Progesterone, 4-androstenedione, 17α-estradiol had the highest event load concentrations and were found at the field that sustained dairy cattle grazing during the winter and were likely due to application of excreta on frozen soil. The high progesterone event loads could lead to concentrations in receiving streams that exceed the lowest observable effects concentrations for fish. There was a consistent association with the elevated zearalenone presence and corn production. The synthetic hormones, 17α-trenbolone and 17β-trenbolone, were not detected in runoff from the beef farm that utilized trenbolone acetate implants, which is likely due to their short half lives. Estrogenic activity in runoff samples ranged from 0.09 to 133 ng/L estradiol equivalents, with 39% of runoff events exceeding the 2 ng/L predicted-no-effect-concentration for fish.

A total of 82 characteristic odors were identified using GC×GC-TOF/MS. Fifteen volatile compounds with the highest odor activity values (OAV > 100) were selected as the key odors contributing to the flavor profile of microwaved sesame oil, including 2-methyl-propanal (pungent, malt, green), 2-methyl-butanal (cocoa, almond), furaneol (caramel), 1-octen-3-one (mushroom), 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one (sweet), 1-nonanol (fat, citrus, green), 2-methyl-phenol (phenol), 2-methoxy-phenol (smoke, sweet), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove, curry), 2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine (cocoa, roasted nut, roast beef), 2-furfurylthiol (coffee, roast), 2-thiophenemethanethiol (sulfur), methanethiol (gasoline, garlic), methional (cooked potato), and dimethyl trisulfide (fish, cabbage). The OAVs significantly increased with a longer microwave process. Meanwhile, PCA results based on E-nose and cluster analysis results based on GC×GC-TOF/MS were similar to distinguish flavor formation during the microwave process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Sesame oils were prepared by a microwave process. Aroma-active compounds with the highest OAVs in sesame oils were not clear. Identification of key aroma compounds of sesame oils could adopt a comprehensive assessment method in combination with E-nose and individual odors detection. Microwave pretreatment as a new processing technology for sesame oil extraction could reduce the time consumption and produce a unique fragrant flavor compared to the traditional roasting process.",Journal of food biochemistry,"['D062609', 'D005421', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008872', 'D009812', 'D012639', 'D012715', 'D052617', 'D013649', 'D055549']","['Electronic Nose', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Microwaves', 'Odorants', 'Seeds', 'Sesame Oil', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Identification of key aroma-active compounds in sesame oil from microwaved seeds using E-nose and HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOF/MS.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608473,2020

We present sets of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, which turned out to be the source of 105 heat-stable peptides, detectable in processed meat using LC-MS/MS. A list of heat-stable species-specific peptides was compiled for eleven types of white and red meat including chicken, duck, goose, turkey, pork, beef, lamb, rabbit, buffalo, deer, and horse meat, which can be used as markers for meat authentication. Among the 105 peptides, 57 were verified by multiple reaction monitoring, enabling identification of each species with high specificity and selectivity. The most described and monitored species by LC-MS/MS so far are chicken and pork with 26 confirmed heat-stable peptide markers for each meat.

We focused our research to determine the amount of free cysteine consumed highly in foods such as pork, beef, poultry, eggs, dairy, red peppers, soybeans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, oats, and wheat germs. A newly designed carbazole-pyridine-based fluorescent probe (CPI) has been introduced for quantitative estimation of cysteine (Cys) with a ""turn on"" fluorescence in some popular processed food samples chosen from our daily diet. CPI shows both naked eye and UV-visible color changes upon interaction with cysteine. The binding approach between CPI and Cys at biological pH has been thoroughly explored by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. From Job's plot analysis, 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between CPI and Cys is observed with a detection limit of 3.8 μM. NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study enlightens the formation of more stable product CPI-Cys. The ""turn on"" response of the probe CPI occurs due to the interruption of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) process upon reacting with cysteine. Moreover, CPI is a very stable, cost-effective compound and exhibits excellent real-time selectivity towards Cys over all other comparative biorelevant analytes.

In humans, a high-fat/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in fat and low in fibre influences the faecal bile acid levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile acid profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n = 8) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food.

28784473,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are superfine cellulose fibrils with a nanoscale diameter and have gained increasing attention due to their great potential in the food industry. However, the applications of CNFs in active food packaging are still limited. The objectives of this study were to develop biopolymer-based edible nanocomposite films using CNFs, corn starch, and chitosan, and to investigate the effect and mechanisms of CNFs on the active functions and properties of the nanocomposite films. Important functional properties of the films were measured and the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Zetasizer. The results demonstrate that CNFs increased the rigidity of the films due to more hydrogen bonds being induced by CNFs (≥60%). Incorporating a high content of CNFs (≥60%) in the film resulted in enhanced filling effect on the structure of the biopolymer films, which significantly improved the light barrier, oxygen barrier and water vapor barrier capacities. As CNF content increased to 100%, the film opacity increased by 59%, while the peroxide value of corn oil protected with edible films was reduced by 23%. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of the edible films with 80% and 100% CNFs were increased by up to 2logCFU/g on day 8 in a beef model, due to more positive charges in the films and improved blocking effects on oxygen. These results demonstrate that CNFs can effectively enhance the antimicrobial effect and barrier properties of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films and have great potential in applications of active packaging for food products.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002482', 'D048271', 'D005516', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D006860', 'D008855', 'D053761', 'D057139', 'D036103', 'D010100', 'D010539', 'D018583', 'D000069466', 'D013056', 'D017550', 'D013213', 'D013499', 'D014867']","['Cellulose', 'Chitosan', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Nanocomposites', 'Nanofibers', 'Nanotechnology', 'Oxygen', 'Permeability', 'Pliability', 'Red Meat', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Starch', 'Surface Properties', 'Water']",Effect and mechanism of cellulose nanofibrils on the active functions of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784473,2019

Measurement techniques based on near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and hyperspectral imaging have provided interesting and promising results for fat and FAs prediction in varieties of foods. Thus, the goal of this article is to give an overview of the current research progress in application of the four important techniques for fat and FAs analyses of muscle foods, which consist of pork, beef, lamb, chicken meat, fish and fish oil. The measurement techniques are described in terms of their working principles, features, and application advantages. Research advances for these techniques for specific food are summarized in detail and the factors influencing their modeling results are discussed. Perspectives on the current situation, future trends and challenges associated with the measurement techniques are also discussed.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D004041', 'D005227', 'D005399', 'D005504', 'D009682', 'D008460', 'D018482', 'D011200', 'D017747', 'D012756', 'D019265', 'D013059', 'D013552']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fishes', 'Food Analysis', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Meat', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Poultry', 'Seafood', 'Sheep', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Swine']",Recent advances in rapid and nondestructive determination of fat content and fatty acids composition of muscle foods.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118034,2018

Different levels of chilli pepper and capsaicin had different inhibitory profiles on HA formation, but had no significant (P>0.05) effect on the texture of the patties. Furthermore, all levels of chilli pepper and capsaicin reduced total HA and PhIP concentrations dose-dependently, with the highest inhibitions of 80% and 98% at 2mg of capsaicin. Moreover, capsaicin inhibited all HAs more than chilli pepper, implying that ingredients other than capsaicin in chilli pepper may promote the formation of HAs.

Iron bioavailability was determined using an in vitro simulated peptic-pancreatic digestion, followed by measurement of ferritin (a surrogate marker for iron absorption) in Caco-2 cells. Cricket and sirloin beef had comparably higher levels of Fe, Ca, and Mn than grasshopper, meal, and buffalo worms. However, iron solubility was significantly higher from the insect samples than from beef. The complementation of whole-wheat flour with insect or beef protein resulted in overall decreases in mineral content and iron solubility in the composite mixtures.

When 44 distinct strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and 6 strains of E. coli O157:NM were tested for inclusivity, all 50 strains produced positive results. In exclusivity testing, 57 strains representing 33 species of closely related Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, including 11 non-H7 O157 strains and shiga toxin-producing E. coli other than O157:H7, were evaluated.

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as ω-3 and ω-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group. The obtained results show that SIMS imaging is a useful approach for assessing changes in lipid concentrations in the meat tissue from animals on different diets and provides a foundation for future research.

Surface application of 0.3% DAPP showed greater (p<0.05) inhibitory effects on HCA formation by 68% for MeIQx, 56% for 4,8-DiMeIQx and 83% for PhIP as opposed to 41%, 21% and 60% respectively, for the mixed DAPP application of 0.3%.

The progressive release of the feed ban required the development of new analytical methods to determine the exact origin of PAPs from meat and bone meal. We set up a promising MS-based method to determine the species and the source (legal or not) present in PAPs: a TCA-acetone protein extraction followed by a cleanup step, an in-solution tryptic digestion of 5 h (with a 1:20 protein/trypsin ratio), and mass spectrometry analyses, first without any a priori, with a Q-TOF, followed by a targeted triple-quadrupole analysis. Using this procedure, we were able to overcome some of the major limitations of the official methods to analyze PAPs, detecting and identifying prohibited animal products in feedstuffs by the monitoring of peptides specific for cows, pigs, and sheep in PAPs.

26203673,"2-Amino-1-methylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) are carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed in well-done cooked meats. Chemicals that induce cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2, a major enzyme involved in the bioactivation of HAAs, also form in cooked meat. Therefore, well-done cooked meat may pose an increase in cancer risk because it contains both inducers of P450 1A2 and procarcinogenic HAAs. We examined the influence of components in meat to modulate P450 1A2 activity and the metabolism of PhIP and MeIQx in volunteers during a 4 week feeding study of well-done cooked beef. The mean P450 1A2 activity, assessed by caffeine metabolic phenotyping, ranged from 6.3 to 7.1 before the feeding study commenced and from 9.6 to 10.4 during the meat feeding period: the difference in means was significant (P < 0.001). Unaltered PhIP, MeIQx, and their P450 1A2 metabolites, N(2)-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-(hydroxyamino)-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (HON-PhIP-N(2)-Gl); N3-(β-1-glucosiduronyl)-2-(hydroxyamino)-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (HON-PhIP-N3-Gl); 2-amino-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline-8-carboxylic acid (IQx-8-COOH); and 2-amino-8-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (8-CH2OH-IQx) were measured in urine during days 2, 14, and 28 of the meat diet. Significant correlations were observed on these days between the levels of the unaltered HAAs and their oxidized metabolites, when expressed as percent of dose ingested or as metabolic ratios. However, there was no statistically significant correlation between the caffeine P450 1A2 phenotype and any urinary HAA biomarker. Although the P450 1A2 activity varied by greater than 20-fold among the subjects, there was a large intraindividual variation of the P450 1A2 phenotype and inconsistent responses to inducers of P450 1A2. The coefficient of variation of the P450 1A2 phenotype within-individual ranged between 1 to 112% (median = 40%) during the entire course of the study. The caffeine metabolic phenotype for P450 1A2 was a poor predictor of oxidative urinary metabolites of PhIP and MeIQx and may not be a reliable measure to assess the role of HAAs in cancer risk.

An ultrasonication and vacuum assisted extraction (UVAE), followed by a multi-stage clean-up procedure, enabled the removal of up to 1g of lipid from 2.5 g of freeze-dried food samples and significantly reduce matrix effects. UVAE achieves a waste factor (WF) of about 10%, while the WFs of classical QuEChERS methods range usually between 50 and 90%. The low WF of UVAE leads to a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity along with saving up to 90% of spiking (internal) standards. Moreover, a two-stage clean-up on Florisil and aminopropyl silica was introduced after UVAE, for an efficient removal of pigments and residual lipids, which led to cleaner extracts than normally achieved by dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). In this way, the extracts could be concentrated to low volumes, e.g. <100 μL and the equivalent matrix concentrations were up to 100g ww/mL. The final analysis of PFRs was performed on GC-EI-MS, while PBDEs and EFRs were measured by GC-ECNI-MS. Validation tests were performed with three food matrices (lean beef, whole chicken egg and salmon filet), obtaining acceptable recoveries (66-135%) with good repeatability (RSD 1-24%, mean 7%).

A total of 256 samples from in-house cooking experiments were produced. There was little evidence of PAH formation during the grilling, frying, roasting and toasting experiments. Comparison with the raw materials used in the experiments showed little or no increase in PAH concentrations for all of the sample types, regardless of distances from the heat source, cooking mediums and intensity of cooking conditions. Barbecuing with charcoal plus wood chips however resulted in the formation of benzo[a]pyrene in most foods; for beef burgers only, barbecuing over charcoal (without the use of wood chips) gave the highest levels. In general PAH levels increased when the food was barbequed closer to the heat source. For sausages cooked over briquettes, and for beef burgers, beef and salmon cooked over charcoal, the concentration of PAHs was lower when the food was closer to the heat source.

In-solution tryptic digests of cooked meats were deposited onto a polymer surface, followed by LESA-MS analysis and evaluation using multivariate data analysis and tandem electrospray MS. The five types of cooked meat were clearly discriminated using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis. 23 heat stable peptide markers unique to species and muscle protein were identified following data-dependent tandem LESA-MS analysis. Surface extraction and direct ambient MS analysis of mixtures of cooked meat species was performed for the first time and enabled detection of 10% (w/w) of pork, horse, and turkey meat and 5% (w/w) of chicken meat in beef, using the developed LESA-MS/MS analysis. The study shows, for the first time, that ambient LESA-MS methodology displays specificity sufficient to be implemented effectively for the analysis of processed and complex peptide digests.

The following study was conducted to validate the proposed modifications against the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) reference methods. E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 and NM (non-motile) 700377 strains were used to inoculate the ground beef, beef trim, and spinach to obtain 20 low (0.23-2 CFU/test portion) and five high levels (3-5 CFU/test portion) of inoculations. Enriched samples were tested directly and subjected to anti-E. coli IMS prior to the SAS Molecular Tests. Results were determined via visual fluorescence and via turbidity using a turbidimeter. All the replicates, irrespective of the results, were confirmed using MLG 5.05 or BAM Chapter 4A methods. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in the detection of fractional positives (5-15 positives out of 20 replicates) with any of the methods tested above as compared to the reference methods.

Solid-state fermentation was carried out using agroresidues for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. Among the substrates, wheat bran supported more enzyme production and has been used for the optimized enzyme production by statistical approach. Two-level full-factorial design demonstrated that moisture, supplementation of beef extract, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate have significantly influenced enzyme production (P < 0.05). A central composite design resulted in the production of 3699 U/mL of enzyme in the presence of 0.3% (w/w) beef extract and 0.05% (w/w) sodium dihydrogen phosphate, at 100% (v/w) moisture after 72 h of fermentation. The enzyme production increased fourfold compared to the original medium. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, diethylaminoethyl-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography, and casein-agarose affinity chromatography and had an apparent molecular mass of 29.5 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for the activity of fibrinolytic enzyme were found to be 8.0 and 60°C, respectively. This enzyme was highly stable at wide pH range (7.0-9.0) and showed 27% ± 6% enzyme activity after initial denaturation at 60°C for 1 h.

This study was conducted to investigate maternal PFAS concentrations and their predictors in years when the production and use of several PFASs declined, and to assess the relative importance of significant predictors. Blood from 391 pregnant women participating in The Northern Norway Mother-and-Child Contaminant Cohort Study (MISA) was collected in the period 2007-2009 and serum analyses of 26 PFASs were conducted. Associations between PFAS concentrations, sampling date, and demographic and dietary variables were evaluated by multivariate analyses and linear models including relevant covariates. Parity was the strongest significant predictor for all the investigated PFASs, and nulliparous women had higher concentrations compared to multiparous women (10 ng/mL versus 4.5 ng/mL in median PFOS, respectively). Serum concentrations of PFOS and PFOA of women recruited day 1-100 were 25% and 26% higher, respectively, compared to those women recruited in the last 167 days of the study (day 601-867), and the concentrations of PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA increased with age. Dietary predictors explained 0-17% of the variation in concentrations for the different PFASs. Significantly elevated concentrations of PFOS, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA were found among high consumers of marine food.

DEHA was assessed as part of the Government of Canada's Chemicals Management Plan. The main source of exposure for most age groups was expected to be food. Although the margin of exposure from food and beverages is considered to be adequately protective, the Government of Canada committed to performing targeted surveys of DEHA in foods and food packaging materials to better define Canadian exposure to DEHA through dietary intake. In order to determine whether more-comprehensive targeted surveys on DEHA in foods should be conducted, 26 food composite samples from the 2011 Canadian total diet study were selected and analyzed for DEHA using a method based on solvent and dispersive solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These 26 food composites include cheese, meat, poultry, fish, and fast foods, and PVC films were likely used in packaging the individual foods used to make the composites. DEHA was detected in most of the meat, poultry, and fish composite samples, with the highest concentration found in ground beef (11 μg/g), followed by beef steak (9.9 μg/g), freshwater fish (7.8 μg/g), poultry liver pâté (7.4 μg/g), fresh pork (6.9 μg/g), cold cuts and luncheon meats (2.8 μg/g), veal cutlets (2.1 μg/g), roast beef (1.3 μg/g), lamb (1.2 μg/g), and organ meats (0.20 μg/g).

The method is based on magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) and GC-MS analysis. Magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) which have excellent adsorption capabilities, were used as adsorbent to extract PAHs, an important class of carcinogens, from meat samples. To obtain the best extraction yields, the influencing factors, including primary extraction conditions, the amount of adsorbent, adsorption and desorption time, salt addition and desorption solvent were investigated in detail. Under optimized conditions, the LODs and LOQs achieved were in the range of 0.035-0.100 and 0.075-0.200 µg Kg(-1) respectively. The calibration curves were linear (r(2) ≥ 0.988) over the concentration ranges from 0.100 µg Kg(-1) to 250 µg Kg(-1) The relative standard deviations (RSDs) obtained by carrying out intra- and inter-day precision studies were less than 13.7% and 13.9%, respectively which confirms reproducibility of the method. In addition, the recoveries of analyzed PAHs ranged from 81.3% to 96.7% with the RSDs less than 12.7 %.

23949006,"Aflatoxin-producing fungi contaminate food and feed during pre-harvest, storage and processing periods. Once consumed, aflatoxins (AFs) accumulate in tissues, causing illnesses in animals and humans. Most human exposure to AF seems to be a result of consumption of contaminated plant and animal products. The policy of blending and dilution of grain containing higher levels of aflatoxins with uncontaminated grains for use in animal feed implicitly assumes that the deleterious effects of low levels of the toxins are linearly correlated to concentration. This assumption may not be justified, since it involves extrapolation of these nontoxic levels in feed, which are not of further concern. To develop a better understanding of the significance of low dose effects, in the present study, we developed quantitative methods for the detection of biologically active aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1) in Vero cells by two independent assays: the green fluorescent protein (GFP) assay, as a measure of protein synthesis by the cells, and the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay, as a measure of cell viability. The results demonstrate a non-linear dose-response relationship at the cellular level. AFB1 at low concentrations has an opposite biological effect to higher doses that inhibit protein synthesis. Additional studies showed that heat does not affect the stability of AFB1 in milk and that the Vero cell model can be used to determine the presence of bioactive AFB1 in spiked beef, lamb and turkey meat. The implication of the results for the cumulative effects of low amounts of AFB1 in numerous foods is discussed.",Toxins,"['D016604', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D002470', 'D002522', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D004797', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D057809', 'D006801', 'D007668', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D012756', 'D014421', 'D014709']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Sheep', 'Turkey', 'Vero Cells']",Non-linear relationships between aflatoxin B₁ levels and the biological response of monkey kidney vero cells.,"['Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949006,2014

A validation study was conducted with nine complex matrices: sorghum, rice, grapefruit, canola, milk, eggs, beef, urine and blood plasma. The method is applicable to all analytes, except aminocyclopyrachlor. The method was deemed appropriate for quantitative analysis in 114 out of 126 analyte/matrix cases tested (applicability rate=0.90). The NH4Cl salting out extraction/cleanup allowed expansion of FI/MS/MS for analysis in food of plant and animal origin, and body fluids with increased ruggedness and sensitivity, while maintaining high-throughput (run time=30s/sample). Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.01mgkg(-1) (ppm), the 'well-accepted standard' in pesticide residue analysis, were achieved in >80% of cases tested; while limits of detection (LODs) were typically in the range of 0.001-0.01mgkg(-1) (ppm). A comparison to a well-established HPLC/MS/MS method was also conducted, yielding comparable results, thus confirming the suitability of NH4Cl salting out FI/MS/MS for pesticide residue analysis.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000643', 'D000818', 'D001826', 'D005504', 'D006540', 'D007306', 'D010573', 'D051381', 'D053719', 'D013696']","['Ammonium Chloride', 'Animals', 'Body Fluids', 'Food Analysis', 'Herbicides', 'Insecticides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Rats', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Temperature']",Ammonium chloride salting out extraction/cleanup for trace-level quantitative analysis in food and biological matrices by flow injection tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23473245,2013

22988791,"According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the ""metabolic pandemics"" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids; palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty acid and its transforms--linoleic, linolenic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of palmitic saturated fatty acid, palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of palmitic/oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma-linolenic fatty acid and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic.

22468327,"Published datasets of proteinaceous animal tissues suggest that co-variation between amino acid hydrogen (δ²H) and oxygen (δ¹⁸O) isotope ratios is a common feature in systems where isotopic variation is driven by geographic or temporal variation in the δ²H and δ¹⁸O values of environmental water. This has led to the development of models relating tissue δ²H and δ¹⁸O values to those of water, with potential application in a number of fields. However, the strength and ubiquity of the influence of environmental water on protein isotope ratios across taxonomic groups, and thus the relevance of predictive models, is an open question.

Significant isotope co-variation was not found for small collections of marine bivalves and crustaceans. These results imply that isotopic signals from environmental water were propagated similarly through most of the diverse natural and human-managed foodwebs represented by our samples. Freshwater fish had the largest variation in δ²H and δ¹⁸O values, with ranges of 121‰ and 19.2‰, respectively, reflecting the large isotopic variation in environmental freshwaters. In contrast marine animals had the smallest variation for both δ²H (7‰ range, crustaceans) and δ¹⁸O (3.0‰ range, bivalves) values. Known-origin beef samples demonstrated direct relationships between the variance of environmental water isotope ratios and that of collected meats.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002645', 'D003903', 'D004531', 'D016018', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D010103', 'D011200', 'D017747']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Deuterium', 'Eggs', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Oxygen Isotopes', 'Poultry', 'Seafood']",Consistent predictable patterns in the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of animal proteins consumed by modern humans in the USA.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22468327,2012
22405465,"We report the isolation of Campylobacter species from the same population of feral swine that was investigated in San Benito County, California, during the 2006 spinach-related Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak. This is the first survey of Campylobacter in a free-ranging feral swine population in the United States. Campylobacter species were cultured from buccal and rectal-anal swabs, colonic faeces and tonsils using a combination of selective enrichment and antibiotic-free membrane filtration methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) was used to identify species followed by confirmatory multiplex PCR or 16S rRNA sequencing. Genetic relatedness of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and porA allele sequencing. Altogether, 12 (40%) of 30 feral swine gastrointestinal and oral cavity specimens were positive, and six species were isolated: Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter hyointestinalsis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter lanienae and Campylobacter sputorum. Campylobacter jejuni subtypes were closely related to MLST sequence type 21 (ST-21) and had identical porA sequences. Campylobacter coli subtypes were unrelated to isolates in the pubMLST/porA database. This feral swine population lived in close association with a 'grassfed' beef cattle herd adjacent to spinach and other leafy green row crop fields. The findings underscore the importance of protecting raw vegetable crops from faecal contamination by wild or feral animals.

High-temperature treatment used to prepare well-done meats increases the formation of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). We evaluated the ability of plant extracts, spices, and essential oils to simultaneously inactivate  E. coli  O157:H7 and suppress HCA formation in heated hamburger patties. Ground beef with added antimicrobials was inoculated with  E. coli  O157:H7 (10(7) CFU/g). Patties were cooked to reach 45 °C at the geometric center, flipped, and cooked for 5 min. Samples were then taken for microbiological and mass spectrometry analysis of HCAs. Some compounds were inhibitory only against  E. coli  or HCA formation, while some others inhibited both. Addition of 5% olive or apple skin extracts reduced  E. coli  O157:H7 populations to below the detection limit and by 1.6 log CFU/g, respectively. Similarly, 1% lemongrass oil reduced  E. coli  O157:H7 to below detection limits, while clove bud oil reduced the pathogen by 1.6 log CFU/g. The major heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) were concurrently reduced with the addition of olive extract by 79.5% and 84.3% and with apple extract by 76.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Similar results were observed with clove bud oil: MeIQx and PhIP were reduced by 35% and 52.1%, respectively. Addition of onion powder decreased formation of PhIP by 94.3%.

22360146,"Anthelmintic drugs are widely used to control parasitic infections in cattle. The ProSafeBeef project addressed the need for data on the exposure of European consumers of beef to potentially harmful drug residues. A novel analytical method based on matrix solid-phase dispersive extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was validated for 37 anthelmintic drugs and metabolites in muscle (assay decision limits, CCα, = 0.15-10.2 µg kg⁻¹). Seven European countries (France, Spain, Slovenia, Ireland, Italy, Belgium and Portugal) participated in a survey of retail beef purchased in local shops. Of 1061 beef samples analysed, 26 (2.45%) contained detectable residues of anthelmintic drugs (0.2-171 µg kg⁻¹), none above its European Union maximum residue limit (MRL) or action level. Residues detected included closantel, levamisole, doramectin, eprinomectin, moxidectin, ivermectin, albendazole and rafoxanide. In a risk assessment applied to mean residue concentrations across all samples, observed residues accounted for less than 0.1% of the MRL for each compound. An exposure assessment based on the consumption of meat at the 99th percentile of consumption of adults in 14 European countries demonstrated that beef accounted for less than 0.02% of the acceptable daily intake for each compound in each country. This study is the first of its kind to apply such a risk-based approach to an extensive multi-residue survey of veterinary drug residues in food. It has demonstrated that the risk of exposure of the European consumer to anthelmintic drug residues in beef is negligible, indicating that regulation and monitoring is having the desired effect of limiting residues to non-hazardous concentrations.","Food additives & contaminants.

The analytes were separated on a core-shell Kinetex C18 column. The mobile phase was composed of methanol and 10-mM N-methylmorpholine. Milk was digested with 0.5 N potassium hydroxide in Milli-Q water, and was extracted with an Atlantic HLB disk to perform automated SPE at a flow rate ranged from 70 to 86 mL/min. Drinking water was directly extracted by the SPE. Solid food samples were digested in alkaline methanol and their supernatants were diluted and also processed by SPE. The disks were washed with 40% methanol/60% water and then eluted with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in methanol. Suppression of signal intensity of most analytes by matrixes was lower than 50%; it was generally lower in fish and drinking water but higher in liver. Most quantitative biases and relative standard deviations were lower than 15%. The limits of detection for most analytes were sub-nanograms per liter for drinking water and sub-nanograms per gram for solid food samples. This method greatly shortened the time and labor needed for digestion, SPE, and liquid chromatography. This method has been applied to analyze 14 types of food samples. Perfluorooctanoic acid was found to be the highest among the analytes (median at 3.2-64 ng/g wet weight), followed by perfluorodecanoic acid (0.7-25 ng/g) and perfluorododecanoic acid (0.6-15 ng/g).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D060766', 'D005399', 'D005466', 'D005504', 'D057230', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D052616', 'D013552', 'D053719', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drinking Water', 'Fishes', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Food Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Swine', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Determination of perfluorinated chemicals in food and drinking water using high-flow solid-phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22071607,2012

Forty-five strains of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum were characterized for their growth capabilities at different temperatures, NaCl concentrations, and pH values and for in vitro lipolytic and proteolytic activities. Moreover, their spoilage potential in meat was investigated by analyzing the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in meat stored in air or vacuum packs. Almost all the strains were able to grow at 4, 10, and 20°C, at pH values of 6 to 9, and in the presence of 2.5% NaCl. The release of VOCs by each strain in beef stored at 4°C in air and vacuum packs was evaluated by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. All the meat samples inoculated and stored in air showed higher numbers of VOCs than the vacuum-packed meat samples. Acetoin, 1-octen-3-ol, and butanoic acid were the compounds most frequently found under both storage conditions. The contaminated meat samples were evaluated by a sensory panel; the results indicated that for all sensory odors, no effect of strain was significant (P > 0.05). The storage conditions significantly affected (P < 0.05) the perception of dairy, spoiled-meat, and mozzarella cheese odors, which were more intense in meat stored in air than in vacuum packs but were never very intense.

The method was based on the microextraction of SAs in 300-mg muscle samples with 1 mL of a supramolecular solvent made up of reverse micelles of decanoic acid (DeA) and posterior determination of SAs in the extract by LC/fluorescence detection, after in situ derivatization with fluorescamine. Recoveries were quantitative (98-109%) and matrix-independent, no concentration of the extracts was required, the microextraction took about 30 min and several samples could be simultaneously treated. Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of the solvent and the target SAs (hydrogen donor and acceptor sum between 9 and 11) were considered as the major forces driving microextraction. The method was validated according to the European Union regulation 2002/657/EC. Analytical performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, trueness, precision, stability of SAs, decision limit and detection capability were determined. Quantitation limits for the different SAs ranged between 12 μg kg(-1) and 44 μg kg(-1), they being nearly independent of matrix composition. Repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, were in the ranges 1.8-3.6% and 3.3-6.1%.

We used various analytical techniques, and the final step was a human study to measure the effect of a candidate compound on iron absorption. Lean beef was selected for study, as it is known to increase nonheme iron absorption. Cooked ground beef was homogenized and aliquots were taken through a simulated gastric and intestinal digestion. This was followed by purification using fast protein liquid chromatography. The fractions were collected and applied to a Caco-2 cell system designed to measure iron absorption using radioiron. Fractions with an enhancing effect were analyzed by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and HPLC, and a proposed empirical formula was obtained for the substance in the most active fraction (C(8)H(20) NO(6)P). Tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the compound as L-alpha-glycerophosphocholine (L-alpha) by comparing the spectra against authentic material. We added a commercially available food grade source of L-alpha to vegetarian lasagna, with and without 100 mg ascorbic acid (a known enhancer of nonheme iron absorption), at the same enhancer:iron molar ratio (2:1), and fed meals to 13 women of child-bearing age with low iron stores. The nonheme iron was labeled with stable isotopes of iron to provide a total dose per meal of 10 mg iron, and absorption was measured from erythrocyte incorporation. Nonheme iron absorption from lasagna was increased by the addition of either ascorbic acid (P = 0.010) or L-alpha (P = 0.023).

We have recently shown that a CLA-rich soy oil can be produced by simple isomerization of linoleic acid in soy oil by photoirradiation. This oil may allow greatly increased dietary CLA without significantly elevating fat intake. The objective of this study was to prepare CLA-rich potato chips by frying in CLA-rich soy oil. Soy oil was photoisomerized in the presence of iodine catalyst with UV/visible light. The irradiated oil was clay processed to remove the residual iodine and this oil was then used to fry potato chips. Oil was extracted from fried chips and analyzed for its CLA content with gas chromatography. A 1-oz serving of CLA-rich potato chips contained approximately 2.4 g CLA as compared to 0.1 g CLA in 3-oz serving of steak fillet and 0.06 g CLA in 8-oz serving of whole milk.

Four pigs fitted with cannulas at the duodenum and jejunum received a meal exclusively made of cooked Pectoralis profundus beef meat or cooked trout fillets. A protein-free meal, made of free amino acids, starch and fat, was used to identify peptides of endogenous origin. Peptides reproducibly detected in digesta (i.e. from at least three pigs) were evidenced predominantly in the first 3 h after the meal. In the duodenum, most of the fish- and meat-derived peptides were characteristic of a peptic digestion. In the jejunum, the majority of peptides appeared to result from digestion by chymotrypsin and trypsin. Despite slight differences in gastric emptying kinetics and overall peptide production, possibly in relation to food structure and texture, six and four similar peptides were released after ingestion of fish or meat in the duodenum and jejunum. A total of twenty-six different peptides were identified in digesta. All were fragments of major structural (actin, myosin) or sarcoplasmic (creatine kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and myoglobin) muscle proteins. Peptides were short ( < 2000 Da) and particularly rich in proline residues. Nineteen of them contained bioactive sequences corresponding mainly to an antihypertensive activity.

Higher levels of BaP were detected in fried chicken (5.25-5.55 BaP microg/kg) and smoked dried beef (5.47 microg/kg) compared to relatively lower levels measured in sesame oil (0.36 microg/kg) and peanut (0.44 microg/kg).

16787045,"Alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are suspected cancer promoters and clastogens, which have raised concerns about the safety of irradiated foods. Currently there are few data on the metabolism of 2-ACBs, which makes it very important to study this aspect of 2-ACBs to evaluate their safety. The objectives of this experiment were to quantify 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB; formed from palmitic acid) in the feces and adipose tissue of rats and to check for metabolites of 2-DCB in the urine. Six female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 2-DCB (5 mg/day) in corn oil for 5 days via gavage. Six control rats did not receive 2-DCB. Feces and urine were collected daily, whereas adipose tissue was collected upon euthanasia. Hexane extracts of feces and adipose tissue were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Urine with and without added beta-glucuronidase was monitored for glucuronide complexes by hexane extraction and GC-MS. The total amount of 2-DCB recovered in feces was 1.78 +/- 0.63 mg at the end of 5 days, which represents between 3 and 11% of the total 2-DCB administered. The total amount recovered in the adipose tissue was 0.08 +/- 0.01 mg, which was approximately 0.33% of the total 2-DCB administered. No metabolites were recovered in any of the urine extracts. The results show that at most 11% of the 2-DCB was recovered unchanged in the feces and adipose tissue.

Incidence of these cancers is increasing in Singapore, a country with 77% ethnic Chinese. The purpose of this study was to estimate HAA levels in the Chinese diet and individual levels of exposure to these compounds because little is known. Twenty-five samples (each pooled from three sources) of meat and fish, cooked as commonly consumed, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for concentrations (ng/g) of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, 2-amino-3, 4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8- dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3, 4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2- amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino -1,6-dimethylfuro[3,2-e]imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, and 2- amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP).

The objective of this research was to determine the concentration of carnosine in human plasma after ingestion of beef. Nine males and nine females were recruited for the study. Food devoid of meat products was given to the subjects so that they did not consume carnosine for 48 h prior to the test. Subjects fasted for 12 h and then had blood withdrawn prior to a meal containing 200 g of ground beef. Additional blood samples were collected over the following 24 h and carnosine concentrations were determined by HPLC. The cooked ground beef used in the study contained 52% water, 24% protein, 22% fat, and 124 mg of carnosine/100 g of beef. No plasma carnosine was detected in subjects before the consumption of the beef. Carnosine was detected in plasma 15 min after beef consumption. Plasma carnosine concentrations continued to increase with a maximum (32.7 mg of carnosine/L of plasma) being recorded 2.5 h after consumption. Carnosine concentrations then decreased until no carnosine could be detected at 5.5 h postconsumption.

Eighty different canned foods purchased from retail outlets in Christchurch, New Zealand, between November 2003 and February 2004 were analysed for BPA concentration by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. BPA was detected in all foods analysed except for soft drinks. Concentrations ranged from < 10 to 29 microg kg(-1), except for individual samples of tuna, corned beef and coconut cream, which were 109, 98 and 191 microg kg(-1) , respectively. The limit of quantitation was <10 microg kg(-1) for foods of low fat content (< 1%) and <20 microg kg(-1) for foods containing >1% fat. Mean concentration data were combined with 24-h dietary recall information for 4399 individual consumers. Mean and maximum exposures were 0.008 and 0.29 microg kg(-1) bw day(-1), respectively, well below the temporary tolerable daily intake of 10 microg kg(-1) bw day(-1) given by the European Commission in 2002. The results of the present survey suggest that the levels of BPA identified in canned foods are unlikely to be of concern to adult health, and there is no reason for consumers to change their consumption patterns as a result of these findings.

The constant neutral loss scan mode was employed to probe for other analytes in urine that display the transition [M+H]+-->[M+H-CH3*]+*, which is common to HAAs containing an N-methylimidazo moiety, and led to the detection of a previously unreported isomer of 8-MeIQx [Holland, R., et al.

The amounts of IQ[4,5-b] measured in the urine of human volunteers who consumed grilled beef ranged from 15 to 135% of the ingested dose, while the amounts of 8-MeIQx and PhIP excreted in urine were on average <2% of the ingested dose. Base treatment of urine at 70 degrees C increased the concentrations of 8-MeIQx and PhIP by as much as 6-fold, indicating the presence of phase II conjugates; however, the amount of IQ[4,5-b] increased by more than 100-fold.

The addition of carbohydrates affected both the weight loss and the formation of HAs during cooking. The formation of HAs could be correlated to depend on both the weight loss and the type of the added carbohydrate. Of the 11 different carbohydrates tested, raw potato starch was most capable of inhibiting the formation of HAs, while potato fiber gave the lowest weight loss and a comparably low amount of PhIP.

The carbohydrase supplement contained xylanase, glucanase, cellulase, and other enzyme activities. The experimental diets were formulated to be suboptimal in major nutrients and each was fed in a mash form to 10 replicate pens of 5 broilers per pen. Body weight gain was not affected by fat type but a poorer feed/gain ratio (P < 0.001) was noted for tallow-containing diets. Regardless of fat type, carbohydrase enzyme supplementation improved (P < 0.001) BW gain and feed/gain ratio. There was no effect of lipase addition on chicken performance and nutrient utilization. When compared with canola oil, tallow-containing diets had a lower (P < 0.001) apparent fat digestibility and consequently a lower dietary AMEn content. Carbohydrase enzyme addition improved (P < 0.001) fat, starch, nitrogen, and nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) digestibilities in the small intestine, improved AMEn, and reduced (P < 0.001) jejunal digesta viscosity in both fat types. Carbohydrase supplementation increased water-soluble (P < 0.001) and decreased water-insoluble (P < 0.001) NSP concentrations in the small intestine. The interaction between fat type and carbohydrase addition was only significant for fat digestibilities, with greater improvements seen for diets containing tallow.

The HAAs were separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography and quantified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI/MS/MS) using selected reaction monitoring. The limits of detection and quantitation of these HAAs approached 1-3 and 2-8 pg/mL, respectively, using only 0.3 mL of urine for analysis. Full product ion spectra were acquired to corroborate analyte identities. The pretreatment of urine from human volunteers that had consumed a grilled beef meal with acid or base at 70 degrees C increased the concentration of HAAs by as much as 6-fold, indicating the presence of phase II conjugates of the parent compounds. HAAs containing an N-methylimidazole moiety undergo facile cleavage of the N-methyl group under collision-induced dissociation conditions, and MS/MS analysis in the constant neutral loss scan mode monitoring the transition [M + H](+) --> [M + H - CH(3)(*)](+) revealed the presence of two other HAAs. 2-Amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx) was identified by coelution of the analyte with synthetic IQx and by acquisition of the product ion spectrum. The second HAA was present in a relatively high abundance in urine. The molecule had the same nominal mass as 8-MeIQx (MH(+) at m/z 214), and the product ion spectrum was similar to that of 8-MeIQx. This novel HAA was also found in the grilled meat consumed by the volunteers at a concentration of 8 parts per billion. The accurate mass measurement and product ion spectrum of this molecule by ESI quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that it was an isomer of 8-MeIQx.

Increasing heating temperatures and times usually increase mutagenic activity in meat and meat extracts during cooking. We developed a model system, which allows to examine the effects of precursor composition and heating conditions (time and temperature) on the formation of HAs in meat. Homogenized and freeze dried meat samples (beef, pork chops, chicken breast and turkey breast) are heated with diethylene glycol in closed vials under stirring in a thermostated heating block. After an appropriate sample preparation (extraction and clean-up) ten different HAs were measured by HPLC analyses with gradient elution and mass selective detection. The time courses of HA-formation in the different kinds of meat at varying heating temperatures were determined up to heating times of 30 min. 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was the most abundant HA in these experiments and reached the highest concentrations in the beef meat samples, as did the other HAs (MeIQ, AalphaC) at 220 degrees C in the heating block under stirred conditions.

The ratio of alkali-labile PhIP metabolites to unmetabolized PhIP varied by 2.7-fold among subjects, ranging from 18:1 to 48:1. In a subsequent study we measured PhIP in acid-hydrolyzed urine from 66 subjects ingesting beef pan-fried at high temperature. A significant correlation (r=0.61, P<0.0001) was observed between the amount of fried meat ingested and concentration of PhIP in urines collected between 0 and 12h after feeding. Other investigators have identified 2-OH-PhIP in acid-hydrolyzed urine from these subjects, and also observed a significant correlation (r=0.52, P<0.0001) with the amount of fried meat ingested. Additional studies have measured PhIP metabolites in subjects consuming their normal (unrestricted) diet. PhIP was detected in acid-hydrolyzed urine from 20 to 50% of these subjects, depending on ethnic group. Taken together, these studies indicate that significant amounts of PhIP are bioavailable from ingestion of fried or char-broiled meats, and that urinary PhIP metabolites reflect recent (12-24h) ingestion. Furthermore, significant interindividual differences in the amounts of urinary PhIP metabolite excreted are observed following ingestion of similar amounts of PhIP. These differences do not correlate with interindividual differences in excretion of urinary pyrene metabolites in the same individuals after ingestion of char-broiled beef, indicating that levels of PhIP and pyrene metabolites in human urine are mediated by compound-specific metabolic factors.",Mutation research,"['D000818', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D003296', 'D004044', 'D004435', 'D020719', 'D006571', 'D006801', 'D007093', 'D008461', 'D009153', 'D009369', 'D011810']","['Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Eating', 'Glucuronides', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Meat Products', 'Mutagens', 'Neoplasms', 'Quinoxalines']","Metabolites of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (PhIP) in human urine after consumption of charbroiled or fried beef.","[None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000652', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000139', 'Q000652']","[None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'urine', 'adverse effects', None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', 'chemically induced', 'urine']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351156,2002
12351155,"We are working to understand possible human health effects from exposure to heterocyclic amines that are formed in meat during cooking. Laboratory-cooked beef, pork, and chicken are capable of producing tens of nanograms of MeIQx, IFP, and PhIP per gram of meat and smaller amounts of other heteroyclic amines. Well-done restaurant-cooked beef, pork, and chicken may contain PhIP and IFP at concentrations as high as tens of nanograms per gram and MeIQx at levels up to 3 ng/g. Although well-done chicken breast prepared in the laboratory may contain large amounts of PhIP, a survey of flame-grilled meat samples cooked in private homes showed PhIP levels in beef steak and chicken breast are not significantly different (P=0.36). The extremely high PhIP levels reported in some studies of grilled chicken are not seen in home-cooked samples.Many studies suggest individuals may have varying susceptibility to carcinogens and that diet may influence metabolism, thus affecting cancer susceptibility. To understand the human metabolism of PhIP, we examined urinary metabolites of PhIP in volunteers following a single well-done meat exposure. Using solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS, we quantified four major PhIP metabolites in human urine. In addition to investigating individual variation, we examined the interaction of PhIP with a potentially chemopreventive food. In a preliminary study of the effect of broccoli on PhIP metabolism, we fed chicken to six volunteers before and after eating steamed broccoli daily for 3 days. Preliminary results suggest that broccoli, which contains isothiocyanates shown to induce Phases I and II metabolism in vitro, may affect both the rate of metabolite excretion and the metabolic products of a dietary carcinogen. This newly developed methodology will allow us to assess prevention strategies that reduce the possible risks associated with PhIP exposure.",Mutation research,"['D000588', 'D000818', 'D002273', 'D002645', 'D002853', 'D003296', 'D006571', 'D006801', 'D007093', 'D008460', 'D009153', 'D011725', 'D011804']","['Amines', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Meat', 'Mutagens', 'Pyridines', 'Quinolines']",Factors affecting human heterocyclic amine intake and the metabolism of PhIP.,"['Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000652', 'Q000652']","['administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'urine', 'urine']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12351155,2002

Treatment with fish FMEP extract caused greater increases of intracellular peroxide production and glutathione content than did beef and pork FMEP extracts. Treatment with 200 microg/ml beef, fish or pork FMEP extract for 6 h increased benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin and methoxyresorufin O-dealkylases activities in S9. Immunoblot analysis of S9 proteins from control cells and cells treated with FMEP extracts revealed that the airborne particulates increased proteins immunorelated to CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from controls and cells treated with FMEP extracts showed that the cooking by-products increased the levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA. Treatment with 1 microM dibenzo[a,h]anthracene for 6 h increased monooxygenase activities, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 protein and mRNA levels in CL5 cells. Beef FMEP extract and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene also induced CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in human lung carcinoma NCI-H322 cells.

11417661,"The 2-alkylcyclobutanone method was adopted as a European Standard (EN1785) and MAFF Validated Method (MAFF V37) in 1996 for the detection of irradiated food containing fat. As the method requires a relatively long period (ca 2 days) of time for extraction of the 2-alkylcyclobutanones from a foodstuff, a means was sought to increase the speed at which these irradiation markers could be isolated while at the same time decreasing the amount of organic solvents required. Thus, the technique of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was investigated. Results showed that SFE can be used for the rapid extraction (60 min) of lipid from irradiated foods such as chicken, pork, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and from the seeds of irradiated mango and papaya with only 10 mL n-hexane being necessary for collection of the extracted sample. A method was also developed whereby the 2-alkylcyclobutanones can be selectively extracted from irradiated foods without prior extraction of the lipid. The sample extract, in 10 mL n-hexane, is purified through a Florisil SPE cartridge which is washed with 10 mL n-hexane and the 2-alkylcyclobutanones eluted with 10 mL 2% diethyl ether in n-hexane before analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone were selectively extracted from irradiated chicken meat, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and mango as well as from beef burgers and baked products containing irradiated ground beef and liquid whole egg, respectively.

10885619,"F2-isoprostanes (F2-IPs) are formed by the free radical-catalysed oxidation of arachidonic acid. The measurement of F2-IPs, especially 8-epi-PGF2alpha, is recognised as a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation and is currently used as a sensitive index of oxidative stress in vivo. The majority of 8-epi-PGF2alpha present in the circulation occurs in association with lipoproteins which are synthesised in the liver. Since lipoproteins are derived from dietary fatty acids and triglycerides, it is possible that 8-epi-PGF2alpha generated in polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich food (during initial processing/packaging or during meal preparation) may become incorporated within these lipoproteins during synthesis. In view of the growing use of 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a marker of lipid peroxidation in vivo in nutritional or clinical studies, it is therefore important to investigate the possibility that the circulating levels measured could be confounded by the presence of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in food. In this study we evaluated the levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha present in several popular fast-foods, using a combination of solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fast-foods were selected to represent meals prepared from vegetable-, chicken-, fish- and meat-derived ingredients. Total (free + esterified) 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels ranged from 0.09 to 0.73 pmol/g (122-644 pmol/mmol arachidonic acid), with the highest levels present in beef-derived meals. Further investigation of hamburgers and cheeseburgers revealed 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels of 1.83 +/- 0.24 and 0.84 +/- 0.03nmol/mmol arachidonic acid, respectively. Lower concentrations of vitamin E were found in the hamburgers. The postprandial contribution to plasma 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels following ingestion of 100 g portions of these fast-foods would therefore be expected to be no greater than the low picomole range, and would be unlikely to influence the normal endogenous levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha and those produced during oxidative stress.",Free radical research,"['D000818', 'D002784', 'D004032', 'D004041', 'D015237', 'D004435', 'D005227', 'D008401', 'D015227', 'D008054', 'D014810']","['Animals', 'Cholesterol', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dinoprost', 'Eating', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Vitamin E']",Measurement of plasma F2-isoprostanes as an index of lipid peroxidation does not appear to be confounded by diet.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097']","[None, 'blood', None, 'administration & dosage', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'blood', 'methods', None, 'blood', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10885619,2000

Prev., 3: 407-411, 1994) of a positive and statistically significant association between bacon intake and the urinary level of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) among this same group of study subjects. Although there is a statistically significant association between urinary levels of PhIP and MeIQx (2-sided P = 0.001), 10 subjects (8%) displayed extreme discordance between urinary PhIP and MeIQx levels. Several factors, including variable contents of heterocyclic aromatic amines in food, enzymic and interindividual metabolic differences, and analytical methodology determine the degree of concordance between the urinary excretion levels of PhIP and MeIQx. Accordingly, urinary excretion levels of a single heterocyclic aromatic amine can only serve as an approximate measure of another in estimating exposure to these compounds in humans consuming unrestricted diets.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000328', 'D001213', 'D044383', 'D006801', 'D007093', 'D015141', 'D008297', 'D008460', 'D009369', 'D011810', 'D011795', 'D044465']","['Adult', 'Asian Americans', 'Blacks', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Los Angeles', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Neoplasms', 'Quinoxalines', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Whites']","Urinary excretion of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in White, African-American, and Asian-American men in Los Angeles County.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000652', 'Q000453', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000208', 'Q000652', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'urine', 'epidemiology', None, 'adverse effects', 'ethnology', 'urine', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10350440,1999

The studies were performed on 22 cats of various breeds and both sexes, aged between 3 and 7 years, that had been fed a balanced diet, based on beef meat for the previous 6 months. The animals were divided into four groups: I, five clinically healthy cats; II, five clinically healthy cats, receiving 1 ml of oil preparation with food for 6 weeks; III, seven nonpruritic cats with miliary dermatitis, without treatment; and group IV, five nonpruritic cats with miliary dermatitis, receiving 1 ml of oil preparation per day with food for 6 weeks. Every 2 weeks all cats were clinically examined. Determination of the serum lipid profile and composition of the oil preparation was performed using gas chromatography. The concentration of total cholesterol (CHL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction and triacylglycerols (TG) were determined spectrophotometrically. In three sick animals, the dermatological signs disappeared completely. In cats with miliary dermatitis, who did not receive the oil preparation, the ratio of cholesterol and HDL to triacylglycerols was reversed compared with healthy cats and sick animals which had received the oil preparation. The addition of the oil preparation lowered the content of saturated fatty acids in serum, in particular palmitic acid, and increased the content of unsaturated acids, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, n-3). Simultaneously, a nonsignificant rise in arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and a decrease in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, n-6) were found. These observations indicate that cats with miliary dermatitis require an increased amount of n-3 fatty acids in the diet.

9641497,"Cooking meat creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs) through pyrolysis of amino acids and creatinine. Although recognized as mutagenic, the etiological role of HCA in human cancer is unclear, due to the lack of information on the effect of typical food cooking methods on HCA concentrations and on variation in HCA exposure in populations. We estimated overall daily dietary HCA intake and variation in intake between individuals, using recent data on HCA concentrations in various meats prepared by cooking methods, temperatures, and times common in United States in the 1990s. Random samples of 250 participants from each of three large prospective cohorts were mailed a questionnaire to assess frequency of consumption, cooking method, and typical outside appearance of pan-fried, broiled, and grilled or barbecued chicken, fish, hamburger, and steak; fried, microwaved, and broiled bacon; fried sausage; roast beef; and homemade gravy. The 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5,f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) concentrations, measured in composite samples by solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography, were assigned to each food, cooking method, and doneness level. The dietary reports showed approximately 30-fold relative variation in 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline intake, 20-fold for 2-amino- -methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, and over 110-fold for 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5,f]quinoxaline, when the 10th and 90th percentiles of HCA intake were compared (90th/10th percentile value). These reported variations in HCA exposure among participants in these three large cohorts indicates that estimation of HCA intake and determination of association with disease risk are feasible, if additional information on meat cooking methods is obtained.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000328', 'D000588', 'D003296', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008460', 'D008875', 'D009369', 'D011237', 'D011446', 'D012307', 'D011795', 'D014481']","['Adult', 'Amines', 'Cooking', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",Predictors of dietary heterocyclic amine intake in three prospective cohorts.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000178', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'adverse effects', None, 'diet therapy', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9641497,1998

The present study determined the effects of long-term feeding of beef-containing diets with low and high levels of HCAs (in the context of a low or high beef tallow diet) on a standard 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon tumorigenesis protocol. Very lean beef was cooked by a variety of methods at different temperatures, and the levels of the major HCAs (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-f]pyridine) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Diets incorporating beef containing low or high levels of HCAs were fed for 12 weeks, during which DMH was administered to induce colon tumors, followed by various dietary regimens as promotional stimuli. Feeding of a beef diet high in HCAs resulted in more DMH-induced colon adenocarcinomas, but only in the context of a low-fat diet. The high-HCA diets increased stomach tumors in all DMH-treated rats. An apparent interaction of high HCA with a high fat level reduced the colon tumor incidence and tumor numbers in those diets containing both factors.

Eight volunteers participated in the study, each consuming a meal of fried minced beef patties (295 g), boiled potatoes, and a green salad. Urine was collected for two 12-hr periods prior to and following the meal. HAAs were determined in cooked meat and in untreated and acid hydrolysed urine by a series of liquid/liquid extractions, followed by Blue cotton adsorption and finally by a novel derivatized technique for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The primary amino groups were derivatized by acylation with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride, and the resulting amide methylated using diazomethane. Phenolic hydroxyl groups were also methylated by this procedure, making it possible to detect hydroxylated HAAs, possible metabolites or constituents of the fried meat. 4'-Hydroxy-PhIP ¿2-amino-1-methyl-6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[4,5-beta]pyridine¿ (4'-OH-PhIP) was indeed found in meat as well as in urine.

The choice of foods, including beef, pork, poultry, game, fish, egg and sausages, was based on an investigation of an elderly population in Stockholm participating in an analytical epidemiological case-control study on cancer risks after intake of heterocyclic amines. The food items were prepared using normal household cooking practices, and to reflect the wide range of surface browning of the cooked dishes that would be encountered in this population, four cooking temperatures were used in the range 150-225 degrees C. For all food samples, the total amount of heterocyclic amines formed at 150 degrees C was less than 1 ng/g cooked product, and at 175 degrees C less than 2 ng/g. The highest concentrations of heterocyclic amines were detected in fillet of pork, reindeer meat and chicken breast fried at 200 and 225 degrees C and their corresponding pan residues. The total sum of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine was about 1 microgram per 100 g portion (including pan residues) for reindeer meat and chicken breast, and between 1.9 and 6.3 micrograms per 100-g portion for fillet of pork.

Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13-HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water step. The remaining lipid material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE. The extraction and quantitation protocol was applied to the analysis of mammary glands for free 9- and 13-HODE from mice fed isocaloric diets containing 20% corn oil, 5% corn oil, or 20% beef tallow. Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)-HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis.

Quality control samples, analyzed periodically over two years in a blind study, show relative standard deviations ranging from 22 to 38% for the compounds found, variations typical for analysis at ng/g levels. Amounts range from undetectable levels (less than 0.1 ng/g) to hundreds of ng/g of PhIP for frying or grilling at high meat surface temperatures. Beef, chicken, pork and lamb can all have greater than 10 ng/g of PhIP.

9146732,"In an ongoing survey, the presence of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) was determined in processed, ready-to-eat meat products sold as 'meat cuts'. HAAs are a group of recently recognized mutagenic/carcinogenic contaminants in foods that are produced during the heat processing of meat. 16 samples of meat cuts (e.g. turkey breast, salami, chicken loaf, cooked ham, all beef meat, pepperoni, etc.), randomly purchased from supermarkets and specialty food stores in the Ottawa area, were analysed for the presence of eight HAAs. The isolation of HAAs was based on sequential liquid-liquid extraction procedures of the samples at both acidic and basic pH values. The mutagenic activity of these samples was determined using the Ames/Salmonella microsome assay with the strain TA98 plus rat liver S-9 metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of these samples ranged from undetectable to slightly active. The highest mutagenic activity, 141 induced revertants/g, was found in a smoked turkey breast sample. 11 samples were not mutagenic, including two that indicated a tendency for inhibition of the spontaneous revertants. The remaining four samples exhibited very low mutagenic activity. For chemical analysis, the extracts were purified with two solid phase extraction cartridges. Quantitative analysis was performed by using liquid chromatography for separation and mass spectrometry for detection. With the exception of trace amounts (0.4 ng/g) of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in the sample with highest mutagenic activity, the chemical analysis did not detect the presence of any of the eight most frequently found HAAs in fried or broiled meat products.

8994352,"In the fly, thorough retinoid deprivation is possible, to optimize investigation of the effects of vitamin A metabolites and retinoic acid (RA) on visual development. Retinoids had been found to control fly opsin gene transcription, though this finding was contested. Northern blots on Drosophila heads showed that mRNA of Rh1 (the predominant rhodopsin) was high in vitamin A replete controls, very low in deprived flies, and increased upon feeding carrot juice to deprived flies as early as 1 hr. Expression of the ribosomal protein 49 [rp49] gene (the control) was equal both in deprivation and in replacement. Recovery of Rh1 protein upon such carotenoid replacement followed, barely detectable on Western blots at 4 hr but conspicuous by 8 hr. Alternative chromophore deprivation with yeast-glucose food yielded flies with opsin mRNA on Northerns but not rhodopsin, as demonstrated by Western blots, spectrophotometry and the electroretinogram (ERG). Rh1's mRNA but not Rh1 protein resulted from rearing flies from egg to adult on the otherwise deprivational medium supplemented with RA or beef brain-heart infusion. By comparing results from these different media it was concluded that: [1] deprivation and replacement affect opsin gene transcription; and [2] contradictory conclusions were from chromophore deprivation which does not eliminate all retinoid dependent factors which could affect the opsin promoter. Preliminary evidence shows that carotenoid deprivation decreases two proteins relevant to visual function: [1] phospholipase C (PLC); and [2] Drosophila retinoid binding protein (DRBP).",Experimental eye research,"['D000818', 'D015152', 'D015153', 'D002338', 'D004331', 'D004596', 'D005786', 'D015591', 'D012333', 'D017299', 'D014212']","['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carotenoids', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electroretinography', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Microspectrophotometry', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rod Opsins', 'Tretinoin']",Control of Drosophila opsin gene expression by carotenoids and retinoic acid: northern and western analyses.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000494']","[None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'genetics', None, 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8994352,1997

8644687,"To assess the influence of dietary fat composition on rates of oxidation of dietary myristic (MA) and palmitic (PA) acids, eight healthy males consumed prepared solid-food diets for 11 d with 40% of total energy as fat. Fifty-five percent of the energy obtained in the form of fat was provided as butter or beef tallow. On days 8 and 11 of each diet cycle, 20 mg/kg body wt of either [1-(13)C]MA or [1-(13)C]PA was ingested with breakfast. Hourly breath samples were collected over 9 h thereafter and 13CO2 enrichments were determined by using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. The percentage of [13C]MA appearing in breath carbon dioxide over 9 h was more than twofold that of PA (P < 0.01). Diet fat composition did not influence the mean (+/- SEM) percentage 13C recovered over 9 h from either labeled MA (7.1 +/- 1.0% compared with 8.6 +/- 0.9% for butter and tallow, respectively) or PA (3.3 +/- 0.7% compared with 3.0 +/- 0.9% for butter and tallow, respectively). However, net MA oxidation, calculated as the percent recovery of fatty acids in the meal, was greater (P < 0.05) after the butter (329 +/- 45 mg) than after the tallow (212 +/- 25 mg) breakfast. In contrast, no difference was observed in net oxidation of dietary PA between butter (441 +/- 99 mg) and tallow (348 +/- 95 mg) meals.

N-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP1A2 is the major pathway of metbolism of MeIQx and PhIP and is solely responsible for the generation of mutagenic species. Assays for MeIQx and PhIP in foods and body fluids were developed utilising gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with stable isotope labelled analogues as internal standards. Studies using these assays have demonstrated that both MeIQx and PhIP are well absorbed and extensively metabolised following ingestion of amine-containing beef by humans. Studies in which furafylline, a potent and selective inhibitor of human CYP1A2, was administered before ingestion of beef revealed that more than 90% of MeIQx and 70% of PhIP are N-hydroxylated in vivo, probably pre-systemically in the liver.

We examined the relationship between CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity and the excretion of total unconjugated MeIQx in 66 healthy subjects. The subjects ate a control diet for 7 days containing lean ground beef cooked at low temperature. On day 8, they were tested for CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity by caffeine phenotyping. On the evening of day 8, subjects consumed lean ground beef cooked at high temperature containing 9.0 ng of MeIQx/g of meat. The subjects ate 3.1-4.0 g meat/kg body wt. Twelve-hour urine samples were collected and MeIQx was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using linear regression analyses, we found that higher CYP1A2 activity was associated with lower levels of total unconjugated MeIQx in the urine (P = 0.008) when adjusted for amount of meat eaten, while NAT2 activity showed no relationship with the latter. This suggest that a greater percentage of MeIQx is converted to metabolites such as the N-hydroxy derivative when CYP1A2 activity is higher.

In this study we examined the time course and interindividual variation of 1-hydroxypyrene-glucuronide (1-OHP-gluc) excretion in urine and PAH-DNA adduct formation in peripheral white blood cells (WBCs) after charbroiled (CB) beef consumption. As a marker of internal dose, 1-OHP-gluc was measured in human urine using immunoaffinity chromatography and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. PAH-DNA adducts were measured in WBCs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in order to assess macromolecular dose. Ten healthy non-smoking males consumed identical amounts of CB beef on five consecutive days. Multiple blood and urine samples were collected before, during, and after the feeding period. The morning after the first day of CB beef consumption, individual urinary concentrations of 1-OHP-gluc increased 10- to 80-fold (range: 2.0-16.6 pmol/ml urine) above pre-feed baseline concentrations (0.23 +/- 0.11 pmol/ml) in the 10 subjects. 1-OHP-gluc concentration decreased to near baseline levels by 24-72 h after CB beef consumption ended. In contrast, PAH-DNA adducts in WBCs increased markedly in only four of 10 subjects during or after CB beef consumption.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the isolated enzyme revealed ten bands, which were analysed by immunoblotting and direct amino-acid sequencing. The enzyme from wheat is the first bc1-complex that is reported to contain four core proteins (55.5, 55.0, 51.5 and 51.0 kDa). In addition, the wheat bc1-complex comprises cytochrome b (35 kDa), cytochrome c1 (33 kDa) the ""Rieske"" iron-sulphur protein (25 kDa) and three small subunits < 15 kDa. This composition differs from the one reported in fungi, mammals and potato. Partial sequence determination of the large subunits suggests that the 55.5- and 55.0-kDa-proteins represent the beta-subunit of the general mitochondrial processing peptidase, and the 51.5- and 51.0-kDa proteins the alpha-subunit of this enzyme. The bc1-complex from wheat efficiently processes mitochondrial precursor proteins as shown in an in-vitro processing assay. In control experiments the isolated bc1-complexes from potato, yeast, Neurospora and beef, all purified by the same isolation procedure, were also tested for processing activity.

HAAs in cooked meats were purified by either immunoaffinity chromatography or solid phase tandem extraction, which allowed for the simultaneous analysis of 11 HAAs by HPLC. The metabolism of two prominent HAAs, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), was investigated in animal models and in vitro with human tissues to develop strategies for human biomonitoring. MeIQx and IQ are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rodents and transformed into several detoxification products which are excreted in urine and feces. Metabolites result from cytochrome P450-mediated ring oxidation at the C-5 position followed by conjugation to sulfate or beta-glucuronic acid. Other major metabolites include the phase II conjugates, N2-glucuronide and N2-sulfamate. A metastable N2-glucuronide conjugate of the genotoxic metabolite of N-hydroxy-MeIQx was also detected in urine and bile. The binding of both carcinogens to blood proteins was low and suggests that human biomonitoring through protein adducts may be difficult. These metabolic pathways exist in nonhuman primates and several of these pathways also occur in vitro with human liver. The urinary excretion of MeIQx in seven human subjects following consumption of cooked beef or fish ranged between 2 and 22 ng in 12 hr when determined by negative ion chemical ionization GC-MS.

Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

The inhibitory potential of furafylline in vivo was first assessed by determining its effect on clearance of phenacetin to paracetamol by the model CYP1A2-dependent O-deethylation pathway. Furafylline inhibited this reaction by > 99% in all subjects, thus demonstrating its applicability to determining the contribution of CYP1A2 to a given reaction in vivo. A group of 6 healthy male volunteers received either placebo or 125 mg furafylline, in a double-blind balanced crossover design, 2 h prior to consuming a test meal of fried beef containing a known amount of amines. The excretion of PhIP and MeIQx in urine was determined during the subsequent 28 h, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Following furafylline, the excretion of unchanged MeIQx increased 14.3-fold, while that of PhIP increased 4.1-fold (P < 0.01, paired t test). Elimination of both amines was first order and very rapid, with half-lives of < 5 h. The elimination rate constants did not change following furafylline, suggesting that total clearance is limited by hepatic blood flow. Because the elimination of the amines was first order, it was possible to calculate the contribution of CYP1A2 to the clearance of the amines.

Concern that these compounds may be human carcinogens has prompted us to develop immunochemical methods for quantifying these compounds in the human diet and for identifying the parent compounds and metabolites in urine and feces. Previously reported monoclonal antibodies to 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 6-phenyl-2-amino-1-methylimidazo[4,5-f]pyridine (PhIP) were used to purify by immunoaffinity these known mutagens and cross-reacting structural analogs from well-done cooked beef and urine samples. Materials recovered from the immunoaffinity columns were subsequently separated by HPLC to purify the known mutagens from cross-reacting chemicals that co-purify by immunoaffinity. Immunoaffinity chromatography was found to be a rapid means of quantifying individual known mutagens, with a minimum of precolumn sample clean-up required. In addition, this procedure has yielded several new mutagens present in cooked meats that are apparently structural analogs of PhIP. Immunoaffinity techniques were also used to purify metabolites from the urine of rats and humans exposed to MeIQx or PhIP. For MeIQx-exposed rats, the combination antibodies immunoconcentrated 75% of the total urinary radioactivity.

[2-14C]PhIP was administered to mice at a dose equivalent ot the consumption of two 100 g beef patties (41 ng/kg). The biological half-life of PhIP was 1 hr, with 90% of the dose being excreted via the urine. Peak tissue PhIP concentrations were reached within 3 hr, with the highest levels in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by the liver, kidney, pancreas, and thymus. Since the detection limit by AMS is dependent on the natural abundance of 14C, we have achieved further increases in sensitivity by producing mice that have 20% of the natural abundance of 14C. Use of these 14C-depleted animals allows measurements to be made near the natural level of exposure for many environmental carcinogens.

8314395,"Levels of mineral hydrocarbons which have migrated from wax coatings into cheese have been determined for 20 retail samples using a gas chromatographic procedure. Contamination was limited to the outermost 2 mm of cheese in direct contact with the wax where levels of hydrocarbons were found to range from 10 to 150 mg/kg. On a whole cheese weight basis these amounted to < 1 to 27 mg/kg (< 0.2 to 3 mg/dm2 contact area). Components attributed to hydrocarbons in cheese samples remote from the waxed surface (background levels) were typically 3-5 mg/kg. Background levels were subtracted from the results for surface samples to obtain migration values. There was evidence that the surface contamination of cheese with mineral hydrocarbons occurred by a combination of diffusion into the cheese and adhesion of wax components onto its surface. Mineral hydrocarbons are used in the manufacture of the temporary casings used to mould skinless sausages. Of 33 retail products examined, including skinless sausages, hot-dog sausages and frankfurters, 25 (75%) contained levels of mineral hydrocarbons from 10 to 105 mg/kg. These hydrocarbons were shown to be present principally at the surface of the food and so could be attributed to migration. Nine other minced meat products were examined for comparison, including minced beef, pâté, sausage meat and sausages with skins. Levels of mineral oil in these products were insignificant by comparison, typically below the limit of detection of ca 4 mg/kg, indicating insignificant adventitious contamination from routes other than migration.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D005506', 'D006838', 'D008461', 'D008899', 'D013552', 'D014885']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Meat Products', 'Mineral Oil', 'Swine', 'Waxes']",Migration of mineral hydrocarbons into foods. 3.

Little is known about the fate of these compounds in humans or the factors affecting it. We have developed assays based on capillary column gas chromatography-negative ion mass spectrometry capable of the simultaneous measurement of MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP in cooked meat and in human urine using stable isotope labeled analogues. Ten normal, healthy male volunteers were invited to consume a standard cooked meat meal (400-450 g lean beef, cooked as patties on a griddle hotplate) on four separate occasions over a period of 14 months. Following consumption of the test meals, urine was collected from 0 to 8 h, during which time all free amines were excreted and analyzed for MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP. Subjects ingested 240 +/- 9 (SEM) g cooked meat, which contained 2.2 +/- 0.2 ng MeIQx/g meat, 0.7 +/- 0.1 ng DiMeIQx/g meat, and 16.4 +/- 2.1 ng PhIP/g meat. The variability in relative systemic bioavailability was assessed from the percentage of ingested amine excreted unchanged in the urine. Subjects excreted 2.1 +/- 1.1% of MeIQx and 1.1 +/- 0.5% of PhIP ingested as unchanged amine in the urine. Levels of DiMeIQx in urine, if present, were below the sensitivity of our assay (20 pg/ml) and could not be detected in any of the samples analyzed. Irrespective of dose, urinary excretion of unchanged MeIQx or PhIP (expressed as a percentage of the ingested dose) remained constant for each individual subject. The intraindividual coefficients of variation for MeIQx (28.4%) and PhIP (23.7%) were low and the pooled interday (intrasubject) coefficients of variation for both compounds were only 19 and 3.4%, respectively. In contrast, inter-subject (intraday) variation was greater, with pooled coefficients of variation of 145% for MeIQx and 71% for PhIP.

The ability of three of these lectins, immobilized on a variety of supports, to separate these micro-organisms from pure cultures was investigated. Immobilization of the lectins on magnetic microspheres was the most effective method. Immobilized T. vulgaris lectin bound 87-100% of cells from cultures of L. monocytogenes, 80-100% of Staph. aureus, 33-45% of Salmonella spp. and 42-77% of E. coli.

1544148,"Potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines are produced from heated food derived from muscle. These compounds are present at part-per-billion levels and consist primarily of the amino-imidazoazaarene class of chemicals. Additional mutagens present in the meat are not as clearly characterized. Commercial fried-beef patties (hamburgers) have low levels of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 0.1-0.68 ng/g meat for MeIQx and slightly lower for 4,8-DiMeIQx. The formation of these heterocyclic amines can be reduced by microwave pretreatment of meat, with the resulting liquid being poured off before frying. The Ames/Salmonella mutagenic activity was reduced to 5-10% of that of non-microwave-treated samples. MeIQx and DiMeIQx concentrations were reduced to 12% and 50% of levels in the non-microwave-treated samples, respectively. MeIQx adducts, as measured by accelerator mass spectrometry, were found to be linear with doses from 5 mg/kg to 500 ng/kg. Linear DNA binding at low doses is important for assuming linear risk estimation from the high animal-feeding doses causing cancer to the low human-dietary exposures.

The intake of retinoids and carotenoids was also calculated using the most recent Finnish analytical data on food composition. The vitamin A content of beef, chicken and pork liver, all of which contribute of the vitamin A intake, at different times of the year was determined. The beta-carotene intake in Finland varied between 1700 and 2100 micrograms/day, depending on the season. It is obvious that liver consumption plays a significant role in the vitamin A intake. Since the concentration of retinoids in liver, and especially in pork liver, is extremely high, the average vitamin A intake of the Finnish population may exceed 3000 RE/day.

In a preliminary experiment the PEI microcapsules were administered by gavage at 0, 24 and 48 h, with [14C]B[a]P at 2 h to chow-fed BDVI rats; microcapsules were recovered from faeces collected at 24, 48 and 72 h, and then subjected to an extraction sequence showing that the trapped B[a]P metabolites were inconsistent with B[a]P diol epoxide trapping (as previously found) and unaltered by elapsed time or 5-fold dose alteration of B[a]P. Then five groups of F344 rats were fed isocalorically either one of four low-fat human diets or rat chow; in order to investigate influences of diet both on B[a]P and endogenous mutagens, half of each group was tested at 2 weeks with this PEI microcapsule/[14C]B[a]P protocol and then at 3 weeks, PEI-CPTS microcapsules (two gavages). So as to provide a cross-over comparison, the other half of each group was first tested with PEI-CPTS microcapsules followed by PEI microcapsules/[14C]B[a]P 1 week later. The human diets were prepared from cooked British foods so as to simulate the adequate intake of all nutrients required by humans; but with 3-fold differences in intake levels of beef and dietary fibre non-starch polysaccharide (NSP), while ensuring the same intake of available energy, protein, fat and calcium. They gave very similar body-weight gains in the four groups but greatly reduced faecal weight, protein and total faecal enzyme activity compared with chow; the extraction pattern of microcapsule-trapped B[a]P metabolite radioactivity was not significantly altered. However, human diet consumption caused a 2- to 6-fold increase in B[a]P metabolite binding to microcapsules and reductions in microcapsule recovery, net 70-h B[a]P excretion, faecal protein and total activities for beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase; these effects were more pronounced after 3 weeks, presumably due to prolonged dietary adaptation.

Foods 1-4 were fortified with ferrous sulfate, and food 5 was fortified with ferrous fumarate. Blood was obtained at ages 140, 168, and 196 d of age, and the test meal was fed under standardized conditions at 154 d of age. Erythrocyte incorporation of the 58Fe label was determined from the increase in the mass isotope ratio, 58Fe/57Fe, from the baseline value (at 140 d of age) to the follow-up values. The mass isotope ratio was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Geometric mean total iron incorporation into erythrocytes from the test meal of MJEBF fortified with ferrous sulfate (food 2) was 0.05 mg, and from the vegetable-beef product test meal (food 3) was 0.08 mg. The low value for MJEBF is presumably explained by the low level of iron fortification. The low value for the vegetable-beef product may reflect the presence of inhibitors of iron absorption. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporations of iron from the test meals with foods 1, 4 and 5 were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg, respectively.

In only two steps, namely extraction of raw material on Kieselgur followed by medium pressure liquid chromatography on Sephasorb HP, very clean fractions with high recovery rates of mutagenic compounds were obtained, thus allowing isolation and quantitation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. The method was validated on both food grade and bacterial beef extracts as well as fried beef. In 1-5 g samples of beef extracts, levels up to 70 p.p.b. (ng/g) of 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 8-90 p.p.b. of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and up to 8 p.p.b. of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx) were determined. In fried beef, 1 p.p.b. of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 1 p.p.b. of MeIQx were measured.

The overall lowest PCB residues of all food commodities were found in skim milk, lamb, margarine and soups. Among the dairy products the highest PCB isomer levels were found in cheese and butter. The sum of all PCB isomers in these two commodities gave residue levels on a wet basis of 2.0 and 3.4 ng/g respectively. In the meat, fish and poultry class the highest specific PCB isomer levels were found in fish, especially freshwater fish, which contained a total of 21.0 ng PCB/g fish. In addition 28 out of the 34 selected PCB isomers were present in freshwater fish. Residue levels in canned fish were the second highest of all food commodities. The observed total PCB residue levels were below the Canadian guidelines for fish, dairy products, poultry, eggs and beef.

Fifty microCi of 3H-propranolol was administered intravenously simultaneously with a 40-mg oral dose of unlabeled propranolol. Plasma 3H-propranolol was measured by specific extraction and liquid scintillation spectrometry, and unlabeled plasma propranolol was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Feeding significantly reduced (25%) the elimination half-life and increased (52%) the systemic clearance of intravenous propranolol. The increase in the systemic clearance of propranolol after feeding was mostly due to an increase (60%) in apparent hepatic blood flow, which appeared to remain elevated for 5-7 hr. The meal had no influence on the apparent volume of distribution or plasma binding. Feeding did not affect the area under the concentration-time curve of oral propranolol, but significantly delayed the rate of oral propranolol absorption, shifting the time to reach peak plasma levels from 60 to 158 min.

The amino acid profile from each source was scored against three reference patterns, each based on an estimate of human essential amino acid requirements. Protein quality ratings based on chemical score were variable. Both the chemical score and predicted first-limiting amino acid for a given protein often differed with data source and choice of reference pattern. Some of the predictions contradicted those previously validated by bioassays. The variability in protein quality ratings was reduced somewhat by expressing the data as essential amino acid indices. But this also reduced the degree of difference in protein quality among the various proteins. Although the amino acid profile of food proteins provides an important perspective on their nutritive value, it appears that the imprecision and uncertain accuracy of routine hydrolysis and analytical procedures confound the use of amino acid data for regulating protein quality.

The present study reveals that no appreciable amount, or only trace amounts, of MG could be detected in fresh beef, pork, chicken and various fish and shellfish. In addition, almost the same low levels of MG were detected in various processed foods, except in the case of smoked-dried fish products, where the MG values ranged from 18 to 178 mg/kg. Relatively high concentrations of AG, ranging from 40 to 200 mg/kg, could be detected in fresh abalone and top-shell muscles, while fairly high concentrations of AG could be detected in some processed foods. A dried squid product, in particular, was found to contain as high as 650 mg/kg of AG.",IARC scientific publications,"['D000376', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D002645', 'D002849', 'D003404', 'D005399', 'D005504', 'D006146', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D008760', 'D012758', 'D013552']","['Agmatine', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Creatinine', 'Fishes', 'Food Analysis', 'Guanidines', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Methylguanidine', 'Shellfish', 'Swine']",Occurrence of methylguanidine and agmatine in foods.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/567182,1978

864153,"Selected food items appearing on 24-hr. dietary recalls of nineteen volunteers were analyzed for zinc by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Consistent and reproducible results were obtained for the zinc content of the foods. Values ranged from 0.02 +/- 0.01 mg. zinc per 100 gm. for fruit cocktail to 6.77 +/- 0.03 mg. per 100 gm. for London broil. Foods in the meat group had the highest zinc values (0.40 to 6.77 mg. per 100 gm.), followed by the breads and cereals (0.30 to 2.54 mg. per 100 gm.); milk and milk products (0.36 to 0.49 mg. per 100 gm.); vegetables (0.12 to 0.60 mg. per 100 gm.); and fruits (0.02 to 0.26 mg. per 100 gm.)--in that order. When comparisons with published values for zinc content of foods were possible, there was good agreement with the values obtained in this study. Using the zinc content of the analyzed foods, dietary zinc intakes based on 24-hr. recall records were calculated for the nineteen volunteers. Mean dietary zinc intake was 13.3 +/- 7.6 mg. and showed a high positive correlation to dietary energy (r = 0.85) and protein (r = 0.90) intakes.

The lipid is extracted from the sample by a mixed solvent and saponified. The unsaponifiable fraction which contains the cholesterol and other sterols is extracted with benzene. An aliquot is evaporated to dryness and the residue is dissolved in dimethylformamide. The sterols are derivatized to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers. The TMS-cholesterol derivative is quantitatively determined by gas-liquid chromatography, using 5alpha-cholestane as an internal standard. Nine laboratories participated in a collaborative study of the determination of total cholesterol in deviled ham sandwich spread, vegetable beef stew, corned beef hash, frozen chicken pot pie, pizza pepperoni, fish sticks, breaded shrimp, chocolate-covered candy bars, dried whole egg solids, and nonfat dry milk and the results are reported here.

Such fat is highly saturated, containing less than about 4 percent polyunsaturated fatty acids. The unsaturated plant lipids (fats) ordinarily consumed by the ruminant are hydrogenated (saturated) in the rumen. Transport and incorporation of this hydrogenated fat into meat and milk follows. Rumen hydrogenation does not take place until the fat is broken down to free fatty acids, thus establishing the fact that lipolysis is an essential feature of the process.
