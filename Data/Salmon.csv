35033615,"Organic matter from salmon farms has been shown to be assimilated by soft sediment and rocky reef communities within the ecological footprint of salmon farms. Given these findings, another question arises - What other chemicals in salmon feed may be assimilated into wild communities via organic waste from salmon farms? Here we measured a suite of organic contaminants in salmon feed, in organisms used in a controlled feeding experiment, and in reef species collected within the depositional footprint of salmon farms. Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry was used to quantify trace concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and current-use (CPUs) and historic-use pesticides (HUPs) in salmon feed imported to New Zealand. The effect of assimilation of farm-derived organic matter on contaminant profiles differed among species during the controlled feeding experiment and demonstrated that migration of individuals to a farm-associated site has the potential to increase or decrease organic contaminant concentrations. Concentrations of PCBs in Parapercis colias (blue cod), a highly resident, long-lived fish, were significantly higher at farm sites than at reference sites. While these concentrations were relatively low in a global context, this result presents blue cod as an important candidate for future monitoring of organic contaminants around point sources. PCBs and PBDEs measured in wild marine species were all below limits set by the European Union, whereas concentrations of certain HUPs, specifically dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its degradation products and endosulfan, may be of concern as a consequence of alternative anthropogenic activities. Overall, feed imported to New Zealand had relatively low levels of most organic contaminants that, at current levels, are unlikely to result in significant ecological effects to wild communities in adjacent habitats.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D017756', 'D017753', 'D008401', 'D055768', 'D006801', 'D009520', 'D011078', 'D012474', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Ecosystem', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Humans', 'New Zealand', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Salmon', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Organic contaminants in imported salmon feed and their effects on reef ecosystems in New Zealand.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35033615,2022

In the Arctic, dogs rely exclusively on humans for food during the winter, and while stable isotope analyses have revealed dietary similarities at some sites, deciphering the details of provisioning strategies have been challenging. In this study, we apply zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to dog palaeofaeces to investigate protein preservation in this highly degradable material and obtain information about the diet of domestic dogs at the Nunalleq site, Alaska. We identify a suite of digestive and metabolic proteins from the host species, demonstrating the utility of this material as a novel and viable substrate for the recovery of gastrointestinal proteomes. The recovered proteins revealed that the Nunalleq dogs consumed a range of Pacific salmon species (coho, chum, chinook and sockeye) and that the consumed tissues derived from muscle and bone tissues as well as roe and guts.

34053529,"Lipids such as furan fatty acids (F-acids) are the valuable minor bioactive components of food such as fatty fish and plants. They are reported to have positive health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Despite their importance, limited studies are focusing on F-acid determination in dietary seafood. This study aimed to identify and profile non-esterified F-acids and free fatty acids in total lipid extract of seafood such as shellfish and salmon. The lipidomic analysis using liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry led to identifying seven types of free F-acids in shellfish (n = 5) and salmon (n = 4). The identified F-acids were confirmed by their high-resolution masses and acquired mass spectra. The relative concentrations of F-acids in shellfish range from 0.01 to 10.93 mg/100 g of the fillet, and in salmon, 0.01 to 14.21 mg/100 g of the fillet. The results revealed the highest abundance of F-acids in Sakhalin surf clam, Japanese scallop, and a fatty salmon trout. Besides, relative levels of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in these seafoods were compared with each other, suggesting basket clams and salmon trout to have significantly higher levels of PUFAs. The dietary seafoods enriched with F-acids and PUFAs may have possible health benefits.

33719440,"Food authenticity and safety are major public concerns due to the increasing number of food fraud cases. Meat fraud is an economically motivated practice of covertly replacing one type of meat with a cheaper alternative raising health, safety, and ethical concerns for consumers. In this study, we implement the MasSpec Pen technology for rapid and direct meat analysis and authentication. The MasSpec Pen is an easy-to-use handheld device connected to a mass spectrometer that employs a solvent droplet for gentle chemical analysis of samples. Here, MasSpec Pen analysis was performed directly on several meat and fish types including grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef, venison, cod, halibut, Atlantic salmon, sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout, with a total analysis time of 15 s per sample. Statistical models developed with the Lasso method using a training set of samples yielded per-sample accuracies of 95% for the beef model, 100% for the beef versus venison model, and 84% for the multiclass fish model. Predictors of meat type selected included several molecules previously reported in the skeletal muscles of animals, including carnosine, anserine, succinic acid, xanthine, and taurine. When testing the models on independent test sets of samples, per-sample accuracies of 100% were achieved for all models, demonstrating the robustness of our method for unadulterated meat authentication. MasSpec Pen feasibility testing for classifying venison and grass-fed beef samples adulterated with grain-fed beef achieved per-sample prediction accuracies of 100% for both classifiers using test sets of samples. Altogether, the results obtained in this study provide compelling evidence that the MasSpec Pen technology is a powerful alternative analytical method for meat analysis and investigation of meat fraud.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002523', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D012474', 'D013672']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Edible Grain', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Salmon', 'Technology']",Rapid Analysis and Authentication of Meat Using the MasSpec Pen Technology.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719440,2021

The existing forms of Hg in food, particularly Hg bound to proteins, may affect the absorption of Hg by humans and subsequently its potentially toxic effects. However, the knowledge regarding Hg-binding proteins in edible fish muscle is scarce. In the present study, salmon and tuna fish muscles, collected from seven different regions and countries, were analyzed using metallomics- and proteomics-based techniques. The concentration of Hg in sashimi samples ranged from 4.4 to 317.4 ng/g. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) showed that beta-actin was a novel Hg-binding protein from the fish muscles, and this protein could also bind bismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu). Hg bound to beta-actin accounted for approximately 30.2-37.6% of the total Hg in the tuna muscles and was significantly correlated to total Hg in the fish muscles (r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and in the fraction of soluble proteins (r = 0.94, p < 0.01).

Samples were extracted with acetonitrile-water as the extraction solvent with use of a vibrational shaking apparatus with a ceramic homogenizer. After extraction, the acetonitrile extracts were cleaned up by incubation at low temperature (-20 °C, 1 h) to remove fat, followed by dispersive solid-phase extraction using Z-Sep+ and primary-secondary amine as sorbents. Validation was performed following the 2002/657/EC and SANTE/11813/2017 guidelines. The trueness of the method ranged from 87% to 121% and precision ranged from 4.1% to 23.7%, with the exception of cyphenothrin, dicyclanil and azamethiphos. The method developed is particularly advantageous because the use of a vibrational shaker allows unattended extraction of samples and eliminates a laborious tissue disruption step, which increases sample throughput in the laboratory. The sample preparation and chromatographic separations can be performed in 5 and 4 h, respectively, for 36 samples.

31361192,"A liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) screening method was developed previously to analyze for veterinary drug residues commonly found in different types of aquaculture products. This method has been further evaluated for its feasibility to detect several other classes of compounds that might also be a concern as possible contaminants in farmed tilapia, salmon, eel and shrimp. Some chemicals could contaminate water sources used in aquaculture production through agricultural run-off. These compounds include several widely used triazine herbicides, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, as well as various discarded human pharmaceuticals. Other possible contaminants investigated were selected disinfectants, some newer antibiotics, growth promoters, and various parasiticides. The sample preparation consisted of an acidic acetonitrile extraction followed by solid-phase extraction clean-up. Data were collected with a quadrupole-Orbitrap MS using both non-targeted and targeted acquisition. This rapid clean-up procedure and HRMS detection method described previously for veterinary drug residues also worked well for many other types of compounds. Most analytes had screening limit levels between 0.5-10 ng/g in the matrices examined using exact mass identification criteria. The strategy described in this paper for testing the performance of additional analytes will help expand the applicability of the HRMS procedure as aquaculture samples can now be analyzed for a wider range of contaminants.","Food additives & contaminants.

31013949,"New protein sources in fish feed require the assessment of the carry-over potential of contaminants and anti-nutrients from feed ingredients into the fish, and the assessment of possible health risks for consumers. Presently, plant materials including wheat and legumes make up the largest part of aquafeeds, so evaluation of the transfer capabilities of typical toxic metabolites from plant-infesting fungi and of vegetable phytoestrogens into fish products is of great importance. With the aim of facilitating surveillance of relevant mycotoxins and isoflavones, we have developed and validated a multi-analyte LC-HRMS/MS method that can be used to ensure compliance to set maximum levels in feed and fish. The method performance characteristics were determined, showing high specificity for all 25 targeted analytes, which included 19 mycotoxins and three isoflavones and their corresponding aglycons with sufficient to excellent sensitivities and uniform analytical linearity in different matrices. Depending on the availability of matching stable isotope-labelled derivates or similar-structure homologues, calibration curves were generated either by using internal standards or by matrix-matched external standards. Precision and recovery data were in the accepted range, although they varied between the different analytes. This new method was considered as fit-for-purpose and applied for the analysis of customised fish feed containing wheat gluten, soy, or pea protein concentrate as well as salmon and zebrafish fed on diets with these ingredients for a period of up to eight weeks. Only mycotoxin enniatin B, at a level near the limit of detection, and low levels of isoflavones were detected in the feed, demonstrating the effectiveness of maximum level recommendations and modern feed processing technologies in the Norwegian aquaculture industry.

30973697,"The application of nontargeted strategies based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) directed toward the discovery of metabolites of known contaminants in fish is an interesting alternative to true nontarget screening. To reduce prolonged and costly laboratory experiments, recent advances in computing power have permitted the development of comprehensive knowledge-based software to predict the metabolic fate of chemicals. In addition, machine-based learning tools allow the prediction of chromatographic retention times (RT) or collision cross section (CCS) values when using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). These tools can ease data evaluation and strengthen the confidence in the identification of compounds. The current work explores the capabilities of in silico prediction tools, refined by the use of RT and CCS prediction, to prioritize and facilitate nontarget liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-HRMS data processing. The fate of the insecticide pirimiphos-methyl (PM) in farmed Atlantic salmon exposed to contaminated feed was used as a case study. The theoretical prediction of 60 potentially relevant biological PM metabolites permitted the prioritization of screening in different salmon tissues (liver, kidney, bile, muscle, and fat) of known and unknown PM metabolites. An average of 43 potential positives was found in the sample matrixes based on the accurate mass of protonated molecules (mass error ≤5 ppm). The application of different tolerance filters for RT (Δ ≤ 2 min) and CCS (Δ ≤ 6%) based on predicted values permitted us to reduce this number up to 66% of the features. Finally, five PM metabolites could be identified; two known metabolites (2-DAMP and N-desethyl PM) were confirmed with a standard, whereas three previously unknown metabolites (2-DAMP glucuronide, didesethyl PM, and hydroxy-2-DAMP glucuronide) were tentatively identified in different matrixes, allowing the first proposition of a metabolic pathway in fish.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D007306', 'D000075663', 'D000069550', 'D013058', 'D015394', 'D009946', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Insecticides', 'Ion Mobility Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'Time Factors']",A Refined Nontarget Workflow for the Investigation of Metabolites through the Prioritization by in Silico Prediction Tools.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973697,2020

Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that tire wear particle (TWP) leachates were most chemically similar to the waters with observed toxicity, relative to other vehicle-derived sources. Prominent road runoff contaminants in the signature included two groups of nitrogen-containing compounds derived from TWP, polyethylene glycols, octylphenol ethoxylates, and polypropylene glycols.

The on-chip separation performance of the device was confirmed by separating and detecting industrial dye (Sudan I) in an artificial aqueous mixture containing 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA), where concentrated plasmonic Au colloid was casted onto the analyte spot for SERS measurement.

In this paper, a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) screening method using a quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument was applied to the analysis of veterinary drug residues in incurred tissues from aquacultured channel catfish, rainbow trout, and Atlantic salmon and imported aquacultured products including European eel, yellow croaker, and tilapia. Compared to traditional MS methods, the use of HRMS with nontargeted data acquisition and exact mass measurement capability greatly increased the scope of compounds that could be monitored simultaneously. The fish samples were prepared for analysis using a simple efficient procedure that consisted of an acidic acetonitrile extraction followed by solid phase extraction cleanup. Two different HRMS acquisition programs were used to analyze the fish extracts. This method detected and identified veterinary drugs including quinolones, fluoroquinolones, avermectins, dyes, and aminopenicillins at residue levels in fish that had been dosed with those compounds. A metabolite of amoxicillin, amoxicillin diketone, was also found at high levels in catfish, trout, and salmon. The method was also used to characterize drug residues in imported fish.

This study examined residual concentrations in water, sediments, and fishes as well as the association between the health risks of OCPs and fish consumption in the Taiwanese population. Various water and sediment samples from Taiwanese aquaculture and fish samples from different sources were collected and analyzed through gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the concentrations of 20 OCPs, namely, aldrin; cis-chlordane; trans-chlordane; dieldrin; endrin; alpha-endosulfan; beta-endosulfan; heptachlor; hexachlorobenzene; alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane; beta-hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; mirex; pentachlorobenzene; o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT); p,p'-DDT; and DDT metabolites (o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [DDD]; p,p'-DDD; o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE]; and p,p'-DDE). None of the analyzed samples was positive for OCP contamination, suggesting no new input pollution from the land through washing into Taiwanese aquaculture environments. However, OCP residues were detected in fishes caught along the coast, namely, skipjack tuna and bigeye barracuda, and in imported fishes, such as codfish and salmon. DDT was the predominant pesticide. The contamination pattern of persistent organic pollutants was as follows: dieldrin > cis-chlordane > hexachlorobenzene, with average concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 2.74 ng/g. The risk was assessed in terms of the estimated daily intake (EDI) for potential adverse indices; the EDI of OCP residues was lower than 1% of the acceptable daily intake established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization. The assessed risk was negligible and considered to be at a safe level, suggesting no association between fish consumption and risks to human health in Taiwan.

CS and DS chain structure varies depending on origin, but motif structure appears consistent. Structures of CS and DS oligosaccharides with different size and sulfate groups were compared between fishes and other animals, and results showed that some minor differences of special structures could be identified by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-liquid chromatography-fourier transform-mass/mass spectrometry (HILIC-LC-FT-MS/MS). For example, data showed that salmon and skipjack CS had a higher percentage content of high-level sulfated oligosaccharides than that porcine CS. In addition, structural information of different origins of CS and DS was analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and results showed that CS and DS samples could be differentiated according to their molecular conformation and oligosaccharide fragments information.

Sea bass, sea bream, Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout from aquaculture analyzed in the present survey showed contamination by emerging Fusarium mycotoxins enniatins (ENs). ENs were extracted from raw and cooked fish with acetonitrile and analyzed by Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. In this study, the stability of ENs was evaluated during food processing by the application of different cooking methods (broiling, boiling, microwaving and baking treatments). All treated samples showed a reduction in mycotoxin levels with different percentages depending on the type of EN and the fish species. Thus, the reduction obtained ranged from 30 to 100%.

27779869,"Ion mobility spectrometry allows for the measurement of the collision cross section (CCS), which provides information about the shape of an ionic molecule in the gas phase. Although the hyphenation of traveling-wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) with high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOFMS) has been mainly used for structural elucidation purposes, its potential for fast screening of small molecules in complex samples has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. The current work explores the capabilities of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a new design TWIMS-QTOFMS for the screening and identification of a large set of pesticides in complex salmon feed matrices. A database containing TWIMS-derived CCS values for more than 200 pesticides is hereby presented. CCS measurements showed high intra- and interday repeatability (RSD < 1%), and they were not affected by the complexity of the investigated matrices (ΔCCS ≤ 1.8%). The use of TWIMS in combination with QTOFMS was demonstrated to provide an extra-dimension, which resulted in increased peak capacity and selectivity in real samples. Thus, many false-positive detections could be straightforwardly discarded just by applying a maximum ΔCCS tolerance of ±2%. CCS was proposed as a valuable additional identification point in the pesticides screening workflow. Several commercial fish feed samples were finally analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

27621283,"Salmon exposed to waterborne metals can experience olfactory impairment leading to disrupted chemosensation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of cadmium (Cd) on salmon olfactory function by modeling an exposure scenario where juvenile salmon transiently migrate through a polluted waterway. Coho were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of waterborne Cd (2 and 30 µg/L) for 48 h and (0.3 and 2 μg/L) for 16 days, followed by a 16-day depuration associated with outmigration. Cadmium exposures inhibited behavioral responses towards L-cysteine and conspecific odorants, with effects persisting following the depuration. Behavioral alterations following the 30 µg/L exposure were associated with increased olfactory epithelial gene expression of metallothionein (mt1a) and heme oxygenase (hmox1); reduced expression of olfactory signal transduction (OST) molecules; and reduced expression of mRNAs encoding major coho odorant receptors (ORs). Salmon OR array analysis indicated that Cd preferentially impacted expression of OST and OR markers for ciliated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) relative to microvillus OSNs, suggesting a differential sensitivity of these two major OSN populations. Behavioral alterations on exposure to 0.3 and 2 µg/L Cd were associated with increased mt1a, but not with major histological or OR molecular changes, likely indicating disrupted OST as a major mechanism underlying the behavioral dysfunction at the low-level Cd exposures. Laser-ablation mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the OSN injury and behavioral dysfunction was associated with significant Cd bioaccumulation within the olfactory sensory epithelium. In summary, low-level Cd exposures associated with polluted waterways can induce differential and persistent olfactory dysfunction in juvenile coho salmon.",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D019256', 'D004305', 'D029941', 'D005786', 'D051547', 'D008668', 'D009812', 'D009831', 'D055696', 'D017684', 'D018035', 'D015398', 'D012903', 'D013997', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cadmium Chloride', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fish Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Metallothionein', 'Odorants', 'Olfactory Mucosa', 'Olfactory Perception', 'Oncorhynchus kisutch', 'Receptors, Odorant', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell', 'Time Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",From the Cover: Cadmium Exposure Differentially Alters Odorant-Driven Behaviors and Expression of Olfactory Receptors in Juvenile Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000633', None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000633']","[None, 'drug effects', 'toxicity', None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621283,2018

26787163,"The parasite Anisakis simplex is present in many marine fish species that are directly used as food or in processed products. The anisakid larvae infect mostly the gut and inner organs of fish but have also been shown to penetrate into the fillet. Thus, human health can be at risk, either by contracting anisakiasis through the consumption of raw or under-cooked fish, or by sensitisation to anisakid proteins in processed food. A number of different methods for the detection of A. simplex in fish and products thereof have been developed, including visual techniques and PCR for larvae tracing, and immunological assays for the determination of proteins. The recent identification of a number of anisakid proteins by mass spectrometry-based proteomics has laid the groundwork for the development of two quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for the detection of A. simplex in fish that are described in the present study. Both, the label-free semi-quantitative nLC-nESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS (MS1) and the heavy peptide-applying absolute-quantitative (AQUA) LC-TripleQ-MS/MS (MS2) use unique reporter peptides derived from anisakid hemoglobin and SXP/RAL-2 protein as analytes.

Preliminary method validation included the assessment of sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility, and applicability to incurred and naturally-contaminated samples for both assays.

With the ban of several chemical control measures, new sustainable methods are needed to mitigate Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Here, PhyloChip-based community analyses showed that the Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas species, represent one of the largest bacterial orders associated with salmon eggs from a commercial hatchery. Among the Pseudomonas species isolated from salmon eggs, significantly more biosurfactant producers were retrieved from healthy salmon eggs than from Saprolegnia-infected eggs. Subsequent in vivo activity bioassays showed that Pseudomonas isolate H6 significantly reduced salmon egg mortality caused by Saprolegnia diclina. Live colony mass spectrometry showed that strain H6 produces a viscosin-like lipopeptide surfactant. This biosurfactant inhibited growth of Saprolegnia in vitro, but no significant protection of salmon eggs against Saprolegniosis was observed.

Moreover, a two-stage clean-up on Florisil and aminopropyl silica was introduced after UVAE, for an efficient removal of pigments and residual lipids, which led to cleaner extracts than normally achieved by dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). In this way, the extracts could be concentrated to low volumes, e.g. <100 μL and the equivalent matrix concentrations were up to 100g ww/mL. The final analysis of PFRs was performed on GC-EI-MS, while PBDEs and EFRs were measured by GC-ECNI-MS. Validation tests were performed with three food matrices (lean beef, whole chicken egg and salmon filet), obtaining acceptable recoveries (66-135%) with good repeatability (RSD 1-24%, mean 7%). Method LOQs ranged between 0.008 and 0.04 ng/g dw for PBDEs, between 0.08 and 0.20 ng/g dw for EFRs, and between 1.4 and 3.6 ng/g dw for PFRs. The method was further applied to eight types of food samples (including meat, eggs, fish, and seafood) with lipid contents ranging from 0.1 to 22%. Various FRs were detected above MLOQ levels, demonstrating the wide-range applicability of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method reported for simultaneous analysis of brominated and organophosphate FRs in food matrices.",Journal of chromatography.

Also, validation is often conducted using only spiked samples, but extraction yields may be lower in incurred samples. In this study, different variables in extraction for incurred pesticides and environmental contaminants in fish were investigated. Among 207 analytes screened using low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, consisting of 150 pesticides, 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 22 other flame retardants (FRs), 35 (16 pesticides, 9 PCBs, 5 PBDEs, and 5 PAHs) were identified for quantification in samples of salmon, croaker, and NIST Standard Reference Material 1947 (Lake Michigan Fish Tissue). Extraction efficiencies using different extraction devices (blending, vortexing, and vibrating) versus time, sample size, and sample/solvent ratio were determined. In comparison to blending results, use of a pulsed-vortexer for 1 min with 1/1 (g/mL) sample/acetonitrile ratio was generally sufficient to extract the incurred contaminants in the homogenized fish tissues. Conversely, extraction with a prototype vibration shaker often took 60 min to achieve 100% extraction efficiency. A main conclusion from this study is that accurate results for real samples can be obtained using batch extraction with a pulsed-vortexer in a simple and efficient method that achieves high sample throughput.

The sample preparation technique was based on the quick, easy, cheap, rugged, effective, and safe (QuEChERS) approach with filter-vial dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). Incurred PBDEs and DDTs were analyzed in three types of fish with 3-10% lipid content: Pacific croaker, salmon, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1947 (Lake Michigan fish tissue). LPGC-MS/MS and ELISA results were in agreement: 108-111 and 65-82% accuracy ELISA versus LPGC-MS/MS results for PBDEs and DDTs, respectively. Similar detection limits were achieved for ELISA and LPGC-MS/MS. Matrix effects (MEs) were significant (e.g., -60%) for PBDE measurement in ELISA, but not a factor in the case of DDT pesticides.

A total of 256 samples from in-house cooking experiments were produced. There was little evidence of PAH formation during the grilling, frying, roasting and toasting experiments. Comparison with the raw materials used in the experiments showed little or no increase in PAH concentrations for all of the sample types, regardless of distances from the heat source, cooking mediums and intensity of cooking conditions. Barbecuing with charcoal plus wood chips however resulted in the formation of benzo[a]pyrene in most foods; for beef burgers only, barbecuing over charcoal (without the use of wood chips) gave the highest levels. In general PAH levels increased when the food was barbequed closer to the heat source. For sausages cooked over briquettes, and for beef burgers, beef and salmon cooked over charcoal, the concentration of PAHs was lower when the food was closer to the heat source.

Of the samples examined, the lowest level of selenium was found in farmed Atlantic salmon (0.17 mg Se kg(−1) dm). The total selenium extraction efficiency by phosphate buffer was 2.5 times higher in sea plankton and shellfish samples than in fish samples. Analysis of Se species in each hydrolysate obtained by proteolysis showed the presence of selenomethionine, which constituted 41.5% of the selenium compounds detected in hydrolysates of Atlantic herring and 98.4% of those in extracts of Atlantic salmon. Inorganic compounds, such as selenates and selenites, were detected mainly in sea plankton and shellfish samples (<0.13 mg Se kg(−1) wm), although no correlation was found between the presence of inorganic compounds and total selenium concentration. The accuracy of the total selenium determination was validated using a certified reference material (oyster tissue (NIST 1566b)). A lyophilised powder of cod (Gadus morhua) was used to validate speciation analysis, enzymatic hydrolysis of lyophilised powder of cod recovered 54 ± 6% of total selenium, and SeMet constituted 83.5 ± 5.28% of selenium detected in hydrolysates.

All samples (n=27) complied with U.S. FDA regulations and five antibiotics were detected above the limits of detection: oxytetracycline (in wild shrimp, 7.7ng/g of fresh weight; farmed tilapia, 2.7; farmed salmon, 8.6; farmed trout with spinal deformities, 3.9), 4-epioxytetracycline (farmed salmon, 4.1), sulfadimethoxine (farmed shrimp, 0.3), ormetoprim (farmed salmon, 0.5), and virginiamycin (farmed salmon marketed as antibiotic-free, 5.2). A literature review showed that sub-regulatory levels of antibiotics, as found here, can promote resistance development; publications linking aquaculture to this have increased more than 8-fold from 1991 to 2013. Although this study was limited in size and employed sample pooling, it represents the largest reconnaissance of antibiotics in U.S. seafood to date, providing data on previously unmonitored antibiotics and on farmed trout with spinal deformities.

This study highlights that downstream movements occur before migration to the ocean during the parr-smolt transformation. Extensive downstream movements of parr appear to be a successful life-history strategy based on variations observed in the otolith elemental signatures of spawners. Movements downstream in parr and the remarkable homing ability of adults also suggest that imprinting to natal streams must occur prior to the parr-smolt transformation.",Journal of fish biology,"['D025041', 'D000818', 'D001955', 'D013058', 'D017683', 'D010037', 'D045483']","['Animal Migration', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oncorhynchus', 'Otolithic Membrane', 'Rivers']",Freshwater movement patterns by juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. before they migrate to the ocean: Oh the places you'll go!,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, 'physiology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25053226,2014

For P1 transgenic fish fed a commercial diet, Δ6-desaturase-like gene (D6D) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) mRNA levels in muscle were up-regulated (P < 0.05) 12.7- and 17.9-fold, respectively, and the D6D mRNA level in the gonad of transgenic fish was up-regulated 6.9-fold (P < 0.05) compared to that of non-transgenic fish. In contrast, D6D and SCD mRNA levels in transgenic fish were dramatically down-regulated (P < 0.05), 50.2- and 16.7-fold in brain, and 5.4- and 2.4-fold in liver, respectively, in comparison with those of non-transgenic fish. When fed a specially formulated diet, D6D and SCD mRNA levels in muscle of transgenic fish were up-regulated (P < 0.05) 41.5- and 8.9-fold, respectively, and in liver 6.0- and 3.3-fold, respectively, compared to those of non-transgenic fish.

24857316,"Pinking is the terminology used for the salmon-red blush color that may appear in white wines produced exclusively from white grape varieties. The isolation of pinking compounds and their analysis by RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS(n) showed that the origin of the pinking phenomenon in white wines from Vitis vinifera L. of Sı́ria grape variety are the anthocyanins, mainly malvidin-3-O-glucoside. The analysis showed that the anthocyanins were located both in the pulp and in the skin. Wine pinking severity was negatively related with the increase of the average temperature of the first 10 days of October, the final period of grape maturation. The minimum amount of anthocyanins needed for the pink color visualization in wine was 0.3 mg/L. The appearance of pinking in white wines after bottling is due to the lowering of free sulfur dioxide, which leads to an increase of the relative amount of the anthocyanins red flavylium form and their polymerization, resulting in the formation of colored compounds resistant to pH changes and sulfur dioxide bleaching.

24754396,"Enantiomeric fractions (EF) are today considered a powerful tool to elucidate selective uptake processes of chiral contaminants in biota. In this study, concentration levels and EF were determined by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH) and trans-, cis-, and oxychlordane in selected Greenlandic traditional food items, collected at the local market in Nuuk in 2010. The food items selected were raw and smoked fish (salmon and halibut, n = 6), whale meat (n = 8), seal meat (n = 2) and narwhal mattak (skin and blubber, n = 6). The EF were nonracemic (≠0.5) for all samples except for α-HCH in narwhal, trans-chlordane in whale and smoked salmon, and cis- and oxychlordane in seal. The EF for α-HCH were significant for all fish samples, but not for mammalian samples. Data indicate that different uptake and/or transformation mechanisms may be responsible for nonracemic distributions of chiral pesticides in mammals and fish species analyzed. There were no general enantiomer-selective transformation/accumulation trends found for chlordanes. Data indicate that enantiomer-specific properties are an important prerequisite for interaction of chiral contaminant with internal metabolic processes. However, marked differences within these groups were identified. The EF in ringed seals were racemic for most of the analyzed pesticides (i.e., chlordanes). However, narwhal were characterized by nonracemic EF for all chiral pesticides analyzed. Median levels of α-HCH ranged from 2 to 24 ng/g lw and from 15.1 to 626.6 ng/g lw for trans-nonachlor, with lowest levels observed in smoked salmon and highest levels in narwhal mattak. This study confirmed that concentration levels of analyzed pesticides in the investigated food items were below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) threshold.

The qualitative validation was performed for over 133 representative pesticides and 24 PAHs at 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg. Subsequent application of the screening method to aquaculture samples made it possible to detect several compounds from the target list, such as chlorpyrifos-methyl, pirimiphos-methyl, and ethoxyquin, among others. Light PAHs (≤4 rings) were found in both animal and vegetable samples. The reliable identification of the compounds was supported by accurate mass measurements and the presence of at least two representative m/z ions in the spectrum together with the retention time of the peak, in agreement with the reference standard. Additionally, the search was widened to include other pesticides for which standards were not available, thanks to the expected presence of the protonated molecule and/or molecular ion in the APCI spectra.

24343452,"Thyroid hormones are critical regulators of normal development and physiological functioning in all vertebrates. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) approaches have been the method of choice for measuring circulating levels of thyroid hormones in vertebrates. While sensitive, RIA-based approaches only allow for a single analyte measurement per assay, can lack concordance across platforms and laboratories, and can be prone to analytical interferences especially when used with fish plasma. Ongoing advances in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) have led to substantial decreases in detection limits for thyroid hormones and other biomolecules in complex matrices, including human plasma. Despite these advances, current analytical approaches do not allow for the measurement of native thyroid hormone in teleost fish plasma by mass spectrometry and continue to rely on immunoassay. In this study, we developed a new method that allows for the rapid extraction and simultaneous measurement of total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) in low volumes (50 μL) of fish plasma by LC/MS/MS. Methods were optimized initially in plasma from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and applied to plasma from other teleost fishes, including fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Validation of method performance with T4- and T3-spiked rainbow trout plasma at 2 and 4 ng/mL produced mean recoveries ranging from 82 to 95 % and 97 to 105 %, respectively. Recovery of (13)C12-T4 internal standard in plasma extractions was: 99 ± 1.8 % in rainbow trout, 85 ± 11 % in fathead minnow, 73 ± 5.0 % in mummichog, 73 ± 1.7 % in sockeye salmon, and 80 ± 8.4 % in coho salmon. While absolute levels of thyroid hormones measured in identical plasma samples by LC/MS/MS and RIA varied depending on the assay used, T4/T3 ratios were generally consistent across both techniques. Less variability was measured among samples subjected to LC/MS/MS suggesting a more precise estimate of thyroid hormone homeostasis in the species targeted. Overall, a sensitive and reproducible method was established that takes advantage of LC/MS/MS techniques to rapidly measure TT4 and TT3 with negligible interferences in low volumes of plasma across a variety of teleost fishes.

23959935,"The kiss1 peptide (kisspeptin), a product of the kiss1 gene, is one of the key neuropeptides regulating vertebrate reproduction. In 2009, we identified a paralogous gene of kiss1 in the brain of amphibians and named it kiss2. Currently, the presence of the kiss2 gene and the kiss2 peptide is still obscure in amniotes compared with that in other vertebrates. Therefore, we performed genome database analyses in primates and reptiles to investigate the molecular evolution of the kiss2 gene in vertebrates. Because the mature kiss2 peptide has been identified only in amphibians, we further performed immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify the mature endogenous kiss2 peptide in the brains of salmon and turtle that possessed the kiss2 gene. Here we provide the first evidence for the presence of a kiss2-like gene in the genome database of primates including humans. Synthetic amidated human KISS2 peptide activated human GPR54 expressed in COS7 cells, but nonamidated KISS2 peptide was inactive. The endogenous amidated kiss2 peptide may not be produced in primates because of the lack of an amidation signal in the precursor polypeptide. The kiss2-like gene may be nonfunctional in crocodilians because of premature stop codons. We identified the mature amidated kiss2 peptide in turtles and fish and analyzed the localization of kiss2 peptide mRNA expression in fish.

Here, a rapid method for the analysis of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB) and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone (2-TCB) in irradiated food products using direct solvent extraction (DSE) was developed, and the extraction efficiency was compared to that of the Soxhlet extraction method (EN 1785), which is the official method for this analysis. Briefly, 2-ACBs were extracted either by using a Soxhlet apparatus or by DSE with n-hexane. The lipid extract was purified by GPC followed by a silica gel cartridge column. Finally, 2-DCB and 2-TCB were measured using GC-MS/MS. The extraction efficiency of 2-ACBs by the DSE method was similar to that of the Soxhlet extraction method. The trueness of 2-DCB and 2-TCB spiked at 50 ng/g in lipid extracts of beef, pork, chicken, cheese and salmon with the proposed method were 76.6% to 91.6% and 81.3% to 109.0%, respectively.

Levels of HCAs have been extensively investigated in meat products but not in fish products. Here, we report levels of HCAs in fried salmon, tuna, hake, sardine, angler fish, cod, sole, swordfish, squid, and cuttlefish. The HCA levels of some of these foods have not been previously analyzed. We employed multivariate factor-analysis tools, including principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression, to study the effects of cooking weight loss and levels of creatine, glucose, and free amino acids on HCA levels. The highest concentrations of mutagenic HCAs, 159.3 ng·g(-1) total, where 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) accounted for 121 ng·g(-1), were found in fried swordfish (cooking loss of 51.8%). These levels are higher than those generally found in fried chicken, which is typically cited as the most contaminated food item. Thus, swordfish is among the richest known sources of HCAs. The other cooked seafood items contained from 0.4 to 35.4 ng·g(-1) HCAs, comparable to concentrations typically reported for meat. Chemometric analysis showed that the fish species is the most influential parameter on the formation of HCAs such as DMIP, PhIP, and norharman. Concentrations of histidine, lysine, creatine, and glucose, as well as weight loss, also influence the yield of HCAs. These results suggest that seafood is an important dietary source of HCAs.

A LC-Q-LIT-MS workflow using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) survey scan, information-dependent acquisition (IDA) triggered collection of EPI spectra, and library search was developed and tested to identify the 240 target pesticides in one single LC-Q-LIT MS analysis. By use of LC retention time, one sMRM survey scan transition, and a library search, 75-87% of the 240 pesticides were identified in a single LC/MS analysis at fortified concentrations of 10 ng/g in 18 different foods. A conventional approach with LC-MS/MS using two MRM transitions produced the same identifications and comparable quantitative results with the same incurred foods as the LC-Q-LIT using EPI library search, finding 1.2-49 ng/g of either carbaryl, carbendazim, fenbuconazole, propiconazole, or pyridaben in peaches; carbendazim, imazalil, terbutryn, and thiabendazole in oranges; terbutryn in salmon; and azoxystrobin in ginseng.

22334277,"The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) has been proposed as an alternative to carbaryl for controlling indigenous burrowing shrimp on commercial oyster beds in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor, Washington. A focus of concern over the use of this insecticide in an aquatic environment is the potential for adverse effects from exposure to non-target species residing in the Bay, such as juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and cutthroat trout (O. clarki). Federal registration and State permiting approval for the use of IMI will require confirmation that the compound does not adversely impact these salmonids following field applications. This will necessitate an environmental monitoring program for evaluating exposure in salmonids following the treatment of beds. Quantification of IMI residues in tissue can be used for determining salmonid exposure to the insecticide. Refinement of an existing protocol using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection would provide the low limits of quantification, given the relatively small tissue sample sizes, necessary for determining exposure in individual fish. Such an approach would not be viable for the environmental monitoring effort in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor due to the high costs associated with running multiple analyses, however. A new sample preparation protocol was developed for use with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantification of IMI, thereby providing a low-cost alternative to LC-MS for environmental monitoring in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor. Extraction of the analyte from the salmonid brain tissue was achieved by Dounce homogenization in 4.0 mL of 20.0 mM Triton X-100, followed by a 6 h incubation at 50-55 °C. Centrifugal ultrafiltration and reversed phase solid phase extraction were used for sample cleanup. The limit of quantification for an average 77.0 mg whole brain sample was calculated at 18.2 μg kg(-1) (ppb) with an average recovery of 79%. This relatively low limit of quantification allows for the analysis of individual fish. Using controlled laboratory studies, a curvelinear relationship was found between the measured IMI residue concentrations in brain tissue and exposure concentrations in seawater.

24786250,"In 2009, a survey of 177 samples of fish and fishery products from the markets in Seoul was carried out to investigate total mercury and organic mercury (methylmercury) concentrations and to establish a correlation, if any, between total and organic mercury levels. Concentrations of total and organic mercury in canned tuna ranged 0.001-2.581 and 0.003-1.307 mg/kg, respectively; those for fish, such as cod or salmon, ranged 0.012-2.529 and 0.021-0.507 mg/kg, respectively. Ethylmercury was not detected. More than 50% of total mercury in the samples existed as organic mercury. The correlation coefficients (r(2)) between total mercury and methylmercury concentrations of fish and fishery products found to have methylmercury were 0.844 and 0.976, respectively, which was statistically significant. There was a higher correlation in fishery products than in fish. Although there was no product in which mercury exceeded the standard set by the Food Code in 2008, with the exception of marlin steak, a processed food, which contained 1.307 mg/kg methylmercury. None exceeded the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for mercury. Collectively, the results indicate that fish or fishery products marketed in Seoul, with the exception of marlin, have low levels of total or organic mercury and, thus, intake of these products is not a risk to public health.","Food additives & contaminants.

21749230,"An efficient LC method was developed for screening the presence of quinolones (QLs)--comprising fluoroquinolones (FQs) and acidic quinolones (AQs)--residues in various livestock and fishery products. Targeted analytes were for nine FQs of marbofloxacin (MAR), ofloxacin (OFL), norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), danofloxacin (DAN), orbifloxacin (ORB), difloxacin (DIF) and sarafloxacin (SAR), and three AQs of oxolinic acid (OXA), nalidixic acid (NAL) and flumequine (FMQ). Samples comprised ten different food products covering five matrices: muscle (cattle, swine and chicken), liver (chicken), raw fish (shrimp and salmon), egg (chicken), and processed food (ham, sausage and fish sausage). This method involved a simple extraction with (1:1) acetonitrile-methanol, a highly selective clean-up with an immobilised metal chelate affinity column charged with Fe(3+), a fast isocratic LC analysis using a short column (20 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 µm) with a mobile phase of (15:85:0.1) methanol/water/formic acid, and fluorescence detection (excitation/emission wavelengths of 295 nm/455 nm for FQs (495 nm for MAR), and 320 nm/365 nm for AQs). Among FQs, pairs of NOR/OFL, ORB/DIF and ENR/DAN were incompletely resolved. A confirmatory LC run with a Mg(2+) containing methanolic mobile phase was also proposed for the samples suspected of being positive. The optimised method gave satisfactory recoveries of 88.5% (56.1-108.6%) and 78.7% (44.1-99.5%) for intra- and inter-day assays with relative standard deviations of 7.2% (0.7-18.4%) and 6.8% (1.4-16.6%), respectively.

Sample wells were covered with mineral oil (barrier for ambient oxygen), and the plate was monitored on a standard fluorescent reader at 30°C. The samples produced characteristic profiles, with a sharp increase in fluorescence above the baseline level at a certain threshold time, which could be correlated with initial microbial load.

Accessions represented four pepper species, Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Capsicum chinense and Capsicum baccatum which were selected by their variation in morphological characters such as fruit color, pungency and origin. Major metabolites in fruits of pepper, carotenoids, capsaicinoids (pungency), flavonoid glycosides, and vitamins C and E were analyzed and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that composition and level of metabolites in fruits varied greatly between accessions and was independent of species and geographical location. Fruit color was determined by the accumulation of specific carotenoids leading to salmon, yellow, orange, red and brown colored fruits. Levels of both O- and C-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin and apigenin varied strongly between accessions. All non-pungent accessions were devoid of capsaicins, whereas capsaicinoid levels ranged from 0.07 up to 80 mg/100g fr. wt. in fruit pericarp. In general, pungent accessions accumulated the highest capsaicinoid levels in placenta plus seed tissue compared to pericarp. The non-pungent capsaicinoid analogs, capsiates, could be detected at low levels in some pungent accessions. All accessions accumulated high levels of vitamin C, up to 200 mg/100g fr. wt.

21377462,"The development of cataract in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) has been related to changes in feed composition resulting in sub-optimal lens nutrition. The present study was performed to investigate the ability of Atlantic salmon lenses to withstand oxidative stress ex vivo, with focus on the nutritional lipid history and exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) as a relevant dietary contaminant. Since dietary histidine has been shown to have a mitigating effect on the prevalence of cataract in farmed salmon, the antioxidative abilities of histidine and NAH, a major imidazole in the salmon lens, was also investigated ex vivo. Lenses from Atlantic salmon prefed diets based on either fish oil (FO) or vegetable oil (VO) as lipid source, with or without addition of 5 mg MeHgkg(-1) feed, were cultured for 96 h in normal medium (control), medium added 5 mM H(2)O(2) or in histidine enriched medium. Lipid class composition of the lenses was not affected by the dietary lipids; while VO fed fish had a decrease in lens n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio due to minor but significant increase in the concentration of 18:2 n-6 and 20:4 n-6, and decrease in 20:5 n-3 fatty acids compared to FO fed fish. The lenses accumulated mercury in response to dietary levels, but neither the oxidative status nor any physiological responses were affected. The cultured lenses responded to H(2)O(2) exposure with loss of transparency, accumulation of auto-fluorescent compounds, volume increase and reduced glutathione concentration similarly and irrespective of the dietary history. Lenses extracted histidine from the media, and synthesised NAH during the culture period. The innate antioxidative defence system appeared to be influenced both by the dietary lipid history and histidine enrichment on a transcriptional level. Catalase and SPARC were expressed higher in lenses from FO fed fish, and glutaredoxin showed elevated expression levels in FO lenses cultured in histidine enriched medium, suggesting that histidine is related to the innate antioxidant defence in salmon lenses. Further, the concentration of NAH was significantly reduced in oxidatively stressed lenses. Based on the results from this study it is suggested that NAH has a novel role as antioxidant in the Atlantic salmon lens.",Experimental eye research,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002374', 'D002386', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D004041', 'D004198', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D005978', 'D006639', 'D006861', 'D007908', 'D050356', 'D008767', 'D009924', 'D015676', 'D018384', 'D010938', 'D020317', 'D017392']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Catalase', 'Cataract', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Fats', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Glutathione', 'Histidine', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Lens, Crystalline', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Osteonectin', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Plant Oils', 'Salmo salar', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances']",Susceptibility of Atlantic salmon lenses to hydrogen peroxide oxidation ex vivo after being fed diets with vegetable oil and methylmercury.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000139', None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', 'Q000031', 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemically induced', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', 'analogs & derivatives', 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21377462,2011
21083629,"Prolactin (PRL)-releasing peptides (PrRP) have been identified in mammals, amphibians and fishes, and these animals have several PrRPs that consist of different numbers of amino acids such as 20, 31 and 37. In the present study, we identified the cDNA encoding chicken prepro-PrRP, which can generate putative PrRPs, and cloned and sequenced it. Sequences for the coding region suggested the occurrence of putative PrRPs of 20, 31 and 32 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of chicken PrRP20 showed 100%, 95% and 70% identity with those of PrRP20s from teleosts, Xenopus laevis and mammals, respectively. On the other hand, chicken PrRP31 showed approximately 90% and 52-55% homology to PrRP31s of X. laevis and mammals, respectively. Native chicken PrRPs were purified from an acid extract of chick brain by a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), affinity chromatography using anti-salmon PrRP serum, and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an ODS-120T column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan). The existence of chicken PrRP20 and PrRP31 in the brain was demonstrated by comparing them with the synthetic peptides using HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Chicken PrRP31 increased plasma PRL concentration when administered peripherally, whereas central administration decreased the concentration, suggesting that chicken PrRP31 has a distinct effect on PRL secretion between tissues in chicks. On the other hand, plasma growth hormone concentration decreased with both peripheral and central administrations of chicken PrRP31. Furthermore, central administration of chicken PrRP31 increased food intake in chicks compared to those observed in mammals and fishes.

20947181,"Rainbow trout often serve as a surrogate species evaluating xenobiotic toxicity in cold-water species including other salmonids of the same genus, which are listed as threatened or endangered. Biotransformation tends to show species-specific patterns that influence susceptibility to xenobiotic toxicity, particularly organophosphate insecticides (OPs). To evaluate the contribution of biotransformation in the mechanism of toxicity of three organophosphate (phosphorothionate) insecticides, (chlorpyrifos, parathion and fenthion), microsomal bioactivation and detoxification pathways were measured in gills, liver and olfactory tissues in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and compared to juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Consistent with species differences in acute toxicity, significantly higher chlorpyrifos bioactivation was found in liver microsomes of rainbow trout (up to 2-fold) when compared with coho salmon. Although bioactivation to the oxon was observed, the catalytic efficiency towards chlorpyrifos dearylation (detoxification) was significantly higher in liver for both species (1.82 and 0.79 for trout and salmon, respectively) when compared to desulfuration (bioactivation). Bioactivation of parathion to paraoxon was significantly higher (up to 2.2-fold) than detoxification to p-nitrophenol in all tissues of both species with rates of conversion in rainbow trout, again significantly higher than coho salmon. Production of fenoxon and fenthion sulfoxides from fenthion was detected only in liver and gills of both species with activities in rainbow trout significantly higher than coho salmon. NADPH-dependent cleavage of fenthion was observed in all tissues, and was the only activity detected in olfactory tissues. These results indicate rainbow trout are more sensitive than coho salmon to the acute toxicity of OP pesticides because trout have higher catalytic rates of oxon formation. Thus, rainbow trout may serve as a conservative surrogate species for the evaluation of OP pesticides in coho salmon.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000704', 'D000818', 'D001711', 'D004390', 'D002851', 'D005284', 'D005880', 'D007306', 'D008862', 'D009831', 'D017684', 'D017686', 'D010278', 'D013045', 'D018675']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fenthion', 'Gills', 'Insecticides', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Olfactory Mucosa', 'Oncorhynchus kisutch', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Parathion', 'Species Specificity', 'Toxicity Tests']","Microsomal biotransformation of chlorpyrifos, parathion and fenthion in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch): mechanistic insights into interspecific differences in toxicity.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000379']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947181,2011
20692313,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) rich oils derived primarily from fish are frequently consumed as supplements. Due to the tendency of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to accumulate in exposed organisms, n-3 PUFA supplements can contain sufficient POPs to present a risk to consumers. Here we investigated PCB concentrations and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity in 17 n-3 PUFA supplements available in Canada. PCBs ranged from <0.8 to 793 ng g(-1) oil, with salmon- and seal-derived products yielding the highest values. AhR agonist activity from a reporter gene assay ranged from 1.3 to 72.2 pg TEQ g(-1) oil, with salmon and tuna yielding the highest values. When consumed at the recommended doses and as a supplement to the average Canadian diet, seal-derived oil can contribute to exceedance of the tolerable daily intake of 20 ng PCBs kg-BW(-1)day(-1), and salmon-, tuna-, and sea herring-derived oils can contribute to exceedance of the tolerable daily intake limit of 2.3 pg TEQ kg-BW(-1)day(-1). The beneficial properties of fish and n-3 PUFA supplements, and the results of this study suggest that it is prudent to consume supplements derived from small, cold-water fatty fish.

20660107,"Volume homeostasis is essential for the preservation of lens transparency and this is of particular significance to anadromous fish species where migration from freshwater to seawater presents severe osmotic challenges. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), aqueous humor (AH) osmolality is greater in fish acclimated to seawater compared with young freshwater fish, and levels of lens N-acetylhistidine (NAH) are much higher in seawater fish. Here we investigate NAH as an osmolyte in the lenses of salmon receiving diets either with or without histidine supplementation. In the histidine-supplemented diet (HD) histidine content was 14.2 g/kg, and in the control diet (CD) histidine content was 8.9 g/kg. A transient increase in AH osmolality of 20 mmol/kg was observed in fish transferred from freshwater to seawater. In a lens culture model, temporary decreases in volume and transparency were observed when lenses were exposed to hyperosmotic conditions. A positive linear relationship between extracellular osmolality and lens NAH content was also observed, whereas there was no change in lens histidine content. Hypoosmotic exposure stimulated [(14)C]-histidine efflux by 9.2- and 2.6-fold in CD and HD lenses, respectively. NAH efflux, measured by HPLC, was stimulated by hypoosmotic exposure to a much greater extent in HD lenses. In vivo, lens NAH increased in response to elevated AH osmolality in HD but not CD fish. In conclusion, NAH has an important and novel role as a compatible osmolyte in salmon lens. Furthermore, it is the major osmolyte that balances increases in AH osmolality when fish move from freshwater to seawater. A deficiency in NAH would lead to a dysfunction of the normal osmoregulatory processes in the lens, and we propose that this would contribute to cataract formation in fish deficient in histidine.","American journal of physiology.

They have been determined in commercial ready-to-eat (RTE) smoked salmon and soft cheese treated with E-beam irradiation. On the basis of experimental design studies and operating conditions of MS detector, best chromatographic conditions were obtained using a Luna® C¹⁸ capillary column (150 mm × 0.3 mm I.D.) with a mixture of acetonitrile-ammonium formate 5 mM pH 3.6 buffer (13:87, v/v) as mobile phase. To improve sensitivity, large injection volumes (20 μL) and injection solutions of low elution strength were employed. Sample preparation procedure included a previous treatment with 1M NaOH, followed by two solid-phase extraction steps; firstly on diatomaceous earth and then on mixed-mode cartridges. Heterocyclic amines were detected neither in irradiated and in non-irradiated samples, indicating that they were not formed by the radiation effect even at doses higher than those indicated in the Food Safety Objective established by regulatory agencies.

The method included pressurized liquid extraction, gel-permeation chromatography (Bio-beads S-X3), solid-phase extraction (silica gel), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The sum concentration of 25 PAHs ([summation operator]PAH(25)) was highest in smoked herring (n = 3) and mackerel fillets (n = 13), with an average concentration of 320 and 235 microg kg(-1), respectively. Lowest average [summation operator]PAH(25) concentrations were obtained for indirectly smoked trout (26 microg kg(-1)). Principal component analysis was used to correlate processing parameters to PAH concentrations and to identify the effects of these parameters. The analysis showed that for salmon hot-smoking conditions lead to higher SigmaPAH(25) than cold smoking, and for other fish species direct smoking leads to higher SigmaPAH(25) than indirect smoking. Also, the usage of common alder increases the PAH contamination compared with beech. The effects of smoking time, combustion temperatures, and two types of smoke-generating material on the [summation operator]PAH(25) were also tested in a pilot plant study with smoked trout as a model fish. In addition to confirming that increased combustion temperatures and usage of common alder in comparison with beech increased [summation operator]PAH(25), it was also revealed that the PAH concentration decreased in the order fish skin >> outer layer of the fish muscle > inner part of the fish muscle.","Food additives & contaminants.

In fresh rested fillets inosine monophosphate (IMP) concentrations reached maximum after 12 h storage (4.78 micromol g(-1)), whereas maximum IMP concentrations occurred immediately postharvest in the exhausted fillets (6.42 micromol g(-1)). After 36 h storage, K-values in exhausted fillets reached 52.11% compared to 19.27% in rested fillets.

The fluoroquinolone residues were determined by UPLC with an HSS T3 C18 reverse-phase column using an ammonium hydroxide-formic acid buffer in an acetonitrile gradient with MS/MS detection using multiple reaction monitoring. Average recoveries for salmon tissue ranged from 73% for DANO to 95% for SARA, for shrimp from 71% for DANO to 109% for SARA, and from 62% for DANO to 111% for SARA in tilapia, fortified at the 1.0 ng g(-1) level.

The liver was selected as the target organ due to its importance in the general metabolism, and 2D gel electrophoresis used as a screening tool. Samples from 12 individual fish from each diet group were evaluated. Of a total of 781 analysed protein spots, only 36 were significantly different by ANOVA (p < 0.05) in abundance between the diet groups. All these spots had low fold differences (1.2-1.6) and high false discovery rate (q = 0.44), indicating minor differences in liver protein synthesis between fish fed GM and non-GM soy. Additionally, low fold differences were observed. Four protein spots were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and identified using a combination of online searches in NCBI and searches in an inhouse database containing salmonid expressed sequence tags and contigs. Follow-up on these proteins by real-time polymerase chain reaction did not identify differences at the transcriptional level.","Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)","['D000821', 'D000824', 'D000818', 'D004032', 'D002149', 'D030841', 'D005786', 'D030821', 'D040901', 'D020317', 'D013025']","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Diet', 'Energy Intake', 'Food, Genetically Modified', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proteomics', 'Salmo salar', 'Soybeans']",Proteomic profiling of liver from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed genetically modified soy compared to the near-isogenic non-GM line.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000662', None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235']","['analysis', None, None, 'veterinary', None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'metabolism', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19618241,2010

19286018,"In May 2007, investigators discovered that waste material from the pet food manufacturing process contaminated with melamine (MEL) and/or cyanuric acid (CYA) had been added to hog and chicken feeds. At this time, investigators also learned that adulterated wheat gluten had been used in the manufacture of aquaculture feeds. Concern that the contaminated feed had been used in aquaculture and could enter the human food supply prompted the development of a method for the determination of CYA residues in the edible tissues of fish and shrimp. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed as a sensitive technique for the analysis of CYA in catfish, tilapia, salmon, trout and shrimp tissue. CYA was extracted from ground fish or shrimp with an acetic acid solution, defatted with hexane, and isolated with a graphitic carbon black solid-phase extraction column. Residues were separated from matrix components using a porous graphitic carbon LC column, and then analyzed with electrospray ionization in negative ion mode on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Selective reaction monitoring was performed on the [M-H](-)m/z 128 ion resulting in the product ions m/z 85 and 42. Recoveries from catfish, tilapia and trout fortified with 10-100 microgkg(-1) of CYA averaged 67% with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 18% (n=107). The average method detection limit (MDL) for catfish, tilapia and trout is 3.5 microgkg(-1). An internal standard, (13)C(3)-labeled CYA, was used in the salmon and shrimp extractions. Average recovery of CYA from salmon was 91% (R.S.D.=15%, n=18) with an MDL of 7.4 microgkg(-1).

18924735,"The concentrations of mercury in forty, commercially available dietary supplements, were determined using a new, inexpensive analysis technique. The method involves thermal decomposition, amalgamation, and detection of mercury by atomic absorption spectrometry with an analysis time of approximately six minutes per sample. The primary cost savings from this approach is that labor-intensive sample digestion is not required prior to analysis, further automating the analytical procedure. As a result, manufacturers and regulatory agencies concerned with monitoring lot-to-lot product quality may find this approach an attractive alternative to the more classical acid-decomposition, cold vapor atomic absorption methodology. Dietary supplement samples analyzed included astragalus, calcium, chromium picolinate, echinacea, ephedra, fish oil, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, goldenseal, guggul, senna, St John's wort, and yohimbe products. Quality control samples analyzed with the dietary supplements indicated a high level of method accuracy and precision. Ten replicate preparations of a standard reference material (NIST 1573a, tomato leaves) were analyzed, and the average mercury recovery was 109% (2.0% RSD). The method quantitation limit was 0.3 ng, which corresponded to 1.5 ng/g sample. The highest found mercury concentration (123 ng/g) was measured in a concentrated salmon oil sample.

18589026,"Changes in diet during the past century have caused a marked increase in consumption of saturated fatty acids and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a concomitant decrease in the intake of n-3 PUFAs. Increased fish consumption has been shown to be the only realistic way to increase dietary quantities of beneficial long-chain n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and re-establish more balanced n-6:n-3 ratios in the diets of human beings. Our objective in this research was to characterize some of the relevant fatty acid chemistry of commonly consumed fish, with a particular focus on the four most commonly consumed farmed fish. To do this, 30 commonly consumed farmed and wild fish were collected from supermarkets and wholesalers throughout the United States. Fatty acid composition of samples from these fish was determined using gas chromatography. The 30 samples studied contained n-3 PUFAs ranging from fish having almost undetectable levels to fish having nearly 4.0 g n-3 PUFA per 100 g fish. The four most commonly farmed fish, Atlantic salmon, trout, tilapia, and catfish, were more closely examined. This analysis revealed that trout and Atlantic salmon contained relatively high concentrations of n-3 PUFA, low n-6:n-3 ratios, and favorable saturated fatty acid plus monounsaturated fatty acid to PUFA ratios. In contrast, tilapia (the fastest growing and most widely farmed fish) and catfish have much lower concentrations of n-3 PUFA, very high ratios of long chain n-6 to long chain n-3 PUFAs, and high saturated fatty acid plus monounsaturated fatty acid to PUFA ratios.

The development and validation of a GI simulator and operational protocols, developed in compliance with the requirements of German DIN 19738 risk assessment test procedure, are presented. Food, naturally contaminated with PCBs, was homogenized with simulated saliva fluid and shaken in the GI simulator with simulated gastric fluids (containing pepsin, mucine) for 2 h at 37 degrees C. Afterwards, the simulated intestinal fluids (containing pepsin, mucine, trypsin, pancreatin, bile) were added and the mixture shaken for a further 6 h prior to centrifugation and filtration using Buchner funnels to separate the undigested GI residues from GI fluids. PCBs were recovered from GI residues and fluids by Soxhlet and liquid-liquid extraction respectively, cleaned up using silica-SFE, and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection (GC-MSD). Detailed studies with fish indicate variations in mobilization and bioavailability of Sigma PCBs (28, 52, 101, 118, 153, 138 and 180). For example, the bioavailable fractions (fractions mobilized) in mackerel, salmon, crab and prawn were 0.77, 0.60, 0.54, and 0.72 respectively of the Sigma PCBs initially present in these food samples. The bioavailable fraction was dependent on the physicochemical characteristics of the PCBs. In mackerel bioavailable fractions for individual PCB congeners ranged from 0.47-0.82, from 0.30-0.70 in salmon, 0.44-0.64 in crab and in prawn from 0.47-0.77. Future studies will focus on understanding better, the variability in bioavailable fractions to be expected for different foodstuffs, in addition to tissue culture techniques using human gut cell lines to investigate a simultaneous mobilization and absorption of food-borne PCBs.","Journal of environmental science and health.

In a randomised and double-blind trial, twenty-eight healthy men consumed 250 g wild or aquacultured salmon daily for 4 weeks which provided 5 mug AST/g salmon flesh. The plasma AST concentrations as well as the isomer distribution were measured by HPLC using a reversed and a chiral stationary phase. After 6 d of intervention with salmon, plasma AST concentrations reached a plateau of 39 nmol/l after consumption of wild salmon and of 52 nmol/l after administration of aquacultured salmon. At days 3, 6, 10 and 14 -- but not at day 28 -- the AST concentrations in human plasma were significantly greater after ingestion of aquacultured salmon. After administration of wild salmon, the (3S,3'S) isomer predominated in plasma (80 %), whereas after intake of aquacultured salmon the meso form (3R,3'S) prevailed (48 %). Therefore, the AST isomer pattern in human plasma resembles that of the ingested salmon. However, after consumption of both wild and aquacultured salmon for 28 d the relative proportion of the (3S,3'S) isomer was slightly higher and the (3R,3'R) form lower in human plasma compared with the isomer distribution in salmon flesh.

Unfortunately, little national contamination data is available to assess food exposure of organotins from French consumers. To provide a more accurate estimate of risks to human health, the butyltin, phenyltin and octyltin compounds sampling in four French coastal areas were measured in 159 composite samples (96 fresh and frozen fish, 28 mollusks, 14 crustaceans, 1 echinoderm, 11 canned foods, 4 smoked fish, 5 prepared seafood-based dishes) by capillary gas chromatography coupled with a microwave induced plasma atomic-emission spectrometer (CGC-MIP-AES). In these samples, butyltins were usually predominant and the range of the contamination levels was generally below those of earlier studies (fish: mean 5.6; min-max 1.1-23 microg/kg; fishery products: mean 6; min-max 0.8-14 microg/kg). Fish, especially tuna, salmon, mackerel, saithe/coalfish and cod were largely the main contributors (38%) to the total organotin exposure.

17599546,"Methylmercury is known to bioaccumulate and biomagnify up the marine food chain. Fish from high levels of the marine food chain may contain relatively high concentrations of mercury, and most (>70%) of the mercury found in muscle is methylmercury. In aquaculture, marine protein (mainly fishmeal) is the dominant source of methylmercury, and this raises some concern with regards to fish welfare and consumer safety. A dietary exposure study, including a depuration period, was carried out in order to study the accumulation and elimination of methylmercury in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), and to estimate the transfer of methylmercury from feed to fish. Fish were sampled throughout a three month exposure period and a three month depuration period. Muscle samples were fractionated into a protein and a lipid fraction by lipid extraction using methanol and chloroform. Mercury and methylmercury were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and gas chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICPMS), respectively. A continuous accumulation of methylmercury, after a lag period of 10 days, was observed in muscle tissue during the three months exposure to methylmercury (0.95+/-0.03 microg Hg/g feed, n=6). After three months, the final concentration in muscle was 0.38+/-0.04 microg Hg/g w w (n=6), where methylmercury constituted 90-95% of the mercury present. The elimination of methylmercury from muscle was slow and incomplete (within the three months of depuration) with an estimated elimination half-life (t1/2) of 377 days. The transfer of methylmercury from feed to Atlantic cod, described by the estimated absorption efficiency, was 38%. In muscle more than 99% of the mercury was found in the protein fraction. These results suggest that Atlantic cod readily takes up dietary methylmercury, which is efficiently accumulated into muscle, where it is incorporated into larger peptides or proteins. Comparable results were found for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). After three months of exposure to dietary methylmercury the final concentration in muscle was 0.33+/-0.01 microg Hg/g w w (n=3), where nearly all (>99%) mercury was found in the protein fraction. This further supports that methylmercury is accumulated in fish muscle, where it is incorporated into larger peptides or proteins.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D004032', 'D004781', 'D048389', 'D008055', 'D008767', 'D009132', 'D011506', 'D011897', 'D020317', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Diet', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Gadus morhua', 'Lipids', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Muscles', 'Proteins', 'Random Allocation', 'Salmo salar', 'Time Factors']",Accumulation and elimination of methylmercury in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) following dietary exposure.,"[None, 'Q000662', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'veterinary', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17599546,2007

17410772,"We hypothesized that depleted fat reserves in grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) following annual hibernation would reveal increases in persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations compared to those present in the fall. We obtained fat and hair from British Columbia grizzly bears in early spring 2004 to compare with those collected in fall 2003, with the two tissue types providing contaminant and dietary information, respectively. By correcting for the individual feeding habits of grizzlies using a stable isotope-based approach, we found that polychlorinated biphenyls (sigmaPCBs) increased by 2.21x, polybrominated diphenylethers (sigmaPBDEs) increased by 1.58x, and chlordanes (sigmaCHL) by 1.49x in fat following hibernation. Interestingly, individual POPs elicited a wide range of hibernation-associated concentration effects (e.g., CB-153, 2.25x vs CB-169, 0.00x), resulting in POP pattern convergence in a PCA model of two distinct fall feeding groups (salmon-eating vs non-salmon-eating) into a single spring (post-hibernation) group. Our results suggest that diet dictates contaminant patterns during a feeding phase, while metabolism drives patterns during a fasting phase. This work suggests a duality of POP-associated health risks to hibernating grizzly bears: (1) increased concentrations of some POPs during hibernation; and (2) a potentially prolonged accumulation of water-soluble, highly reactive POP metabolites, since grizzly bears do not excrete during hibernation.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000273', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D001955', 'D002706', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005247', 'D008401', 'D006197', 'D006605', 'D007553', 'D009930', 'D011075', 'D011078', 'D012621', 'D001503']","['Adipose Tissue', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Chlordan', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hair', 'Hibernation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Polybrominated Biphenyls', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Seasons', 'Ursidae']",Hibernation-associated changes in persistent organic pollutant (POP) levels and patterns in British Columbia grizzly bears (ursus arctos horribilis).,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000706', 'Q000032', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378']","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'statistics & numerical data', 'analysis', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', 'physiology', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17410772,2007

17189915,"A new method for visualizing small and multiple phosvitins (Pvs) in oocytes from a marine teleost was developed by a combination of gel filtration, alkaline phosphatase treatment, and SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Three distinct Pv polypeptides having molecular masses of 15 kDa, 8 kDa, and 7 kDa were visualized in vitellogenic follicle extract of barfin flounder, Verasper moseri. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified two different N-termini that fell into the PvA (7 kDa) and PvB (15 kDa and 8 kDa) groups, which were derived from two forms of vitellogenin (Vg), VgA and VgB, respectively. Analysis of time-course change in phosphorus-rich peaks of gel chromatography fractions of follicle extracts from different maturational stages demonstrated a rapid degradation of Pvs during mid-phase of oocyte maturation. Quantitative analysis of free amino acids in maturing follicles revealed an increment of serine content but not of phosphoserine, indicating the occurrence of dephosphorylation concomitant with Pv degradation. Measurement of phosphatase activity in follicles and eggs at different maturational stages demonstrated a significant activation of phosphatase especially under acidic conditions. This suggested that Pv degradation and dephosphorylation are regulated by changes in ooplasm pH during oocyte maturation. Our results also suggested that the Pvs in barfin flounder vitellogenic oocytes bind to much lower amounts of calcium and magnesium than those of masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou. This indicates that the Pvs in the barfin flounder, a marine teleost spawning its eggs in seawater, do not play a role in the transport and deposition of calcium and magnesium into oocytes.",Zoological science,"['D000818', 'D002118', 'D005432', 'D005786', 'D006863', 'D008274', 'D009865', 'D010774', 'D020033', 'D014819']","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Flounder', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Magnesium', 'Oocytes', 'Phosvitin', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Vitellogenins']","Identification of two forms of vitellogenin-derived phosvitin and elucidation of their fate and roles during oocyte maturation in the barfin flounder, Verasper moseri.","[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17189915,2007

The most common tonnage product among these, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), is widely spread in the environment. The objectives with the present work were to study uptake and metabolism of orally administered DEHP and its major metabolite mono-2-ethyl hexyl phthalate (MEHP) and to evaluate the impact of early life exposure on sex differentiation in Atlantic salmon. The feeding with contaminated diet started immediately after yolk sac resorption and continued for 4 weeks. Nominal concentrations of DEHP in the diet were 400 (measured 359), 800 (measured 827), and 1500 (measured 1648) mg DEHP/kg and a control group was fed food mixed with solvent. After the exposure period, fish were fed non-contaminated diet until final sampling 4 months post-exposure. There were no effects on growth or survival of the fish and no late effects on hepatosomatic index or sex ratio. However, the histological examination of gonads from fish exposed to 1500 mg DEHP/kg revealed a small but significant incidence (3%) of intersex fish (ovo-testis). Chemical residues of DEHP and MEHP were analyzed weekly during the first 3 months of the post-exposure period. Both DEHP and MEHP were rapidly eliminated to near background levels within one week post exposure. The study indicates that exposure of Atlantic salmon to relatively high concentrations of DEHP during a sensitive part of the life cycle may interfere with gonad differentiation.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000704', 'D000818', 'D004032', 'D004051', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D006066', 'D008297', 'D020317', 'D012733', 'D013548']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Diet', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gonads', 'Male', 'Salmo salar', 'Sex Differentiation', 'Sweden']","Studies of uptake, elimination, and late effects in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) dietary exposed to Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) during early life.","[None, None, None, 'Q000031', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000254', 'Q000187', None]","[None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'growth & development', 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17180483,2007
17150295,"The synthetic antioxidant ethoxyquin (EQ) is a widely used additive in animal feeds, including farmed fish feed. The use of EQ as food additive is prohibited and it is also undesirable in farmed meat and fish products. The possible negative aspects of EQ in fish feeds, such as modulation of hepatic detoxifying enzymes and possible effects through ""carry-over"" to edible parts of fish are not known. In addition, the subsequent consequences for human consumers have not been previously studied. In the present work, the alteration in gene and protein expression patterns, and catalytic activities of phase I and II hepatic biotransformation enzymes due to prolonged exposure to graded levels of dietary EQ in the range of 11-1800 mg EQ/kg feed were studied. The kinetics of parent EQ and its major metabolite, ethoxyquin dimer (EQDM) was also studied. In general two weeks seem to be the critical point in the entire toxicological response of salmon to dietary consumed EQ. Biotransformation of EQ to EQDM is shown to be a rapid process. However, the decrease in biotransformation rate results in the accumulation of EQ metabolites, high concentration of which was postulated to alter translation and post-translational modification of CYP3A, GST and UDPGT at feeding day 14 and 42, with subsequent decreases in the biotransformation of consumed EQ. Decrease in the biotransformation of consumed EQ produced the retention of un-metabolized EQ rather than metabolites in salmon liver. This may be considered as undesirable effect, since it could lead to the transport and accumulation in other organs and edible tissues. It may also cause a new wave of biotransformation with formation of metabolites inhibiting detoxifying enzymes. In general, these processes may prolong the excretion of dietary EQ from the fish body and produce EQ-derived residues in the ready-to-consume salmon or fish products. These EQ residues may have higher toxicological effects for human consumers than the parent compound and therefore need to be studied in more detail.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D000821', 'D000824', 'D000818', 'D000975', 'D001711', 'D002851', 'D003257', 'D051544', 'D004305', 'D005015', 'D014453', 'D005982', 'D006801', 'D008099', 'D016133', 'D020317']","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Biotransformation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethoxyquin', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Salmo salar']","Hepatic metabolism, phase I and II biotransformation enzymes in Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar, L) during a 12 week feeding period with graded levels of the synthetic antioxidant, ethoxyquin.","[None, None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000379', 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, 'genetics', None, 'administration & dosage', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'enzymology', 'methods', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17150295,2007

Samples from cattle, pigs, goats, deer, horses, chickens, ducks, ostriches, salmon, cod, shrimp, crabs, scallops, bullfrogs and alligators each exhibited unique electrochemical profiles. Species-specific markers exhibited reproducible peak retention times with coefficients of variation less then 6% across different runs, body regions and subjects. The method requires no derivatization or extraction steps and may be applicable to fresh or cooked meats. Incubation of fresh beef, pork or chicken at room temperature for 24h or repeated freezing and thawing changed the intensity but not the pattern of species-specific peaks. In conclusion, this method appears suitable for rapid differentiation of meats from various food animal species and demonstrates the utility of electrochemical detection to supplement existing immunochemical and molecular biological methods.

Analytical results were validated by spiking the samples with various concentrations of these metals for recovery.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration website provides methylmercury data for a variety of fish, but for many species sample sizes are small and data are more than a decade old, whereas commercial fish sources are highly dynamic. A few state agencies are beginning to provide contaminant information for commercial fish, including canned tuna. We examined the mercury concentration of six types of fish purchased in supermarkets in Chicago, Illinois in 2005. We measured total mercury (methylmercury accounts for about 90% of the total mercury in fish). One key question was whether the concentrations of mercury in fish available locally were similar to those reported in other areas of the country and in the FDA U.S. national data base. Such information is critical for the public, especially pregnant women or those planning on pregnancy, making decisions about types and quantities of fish to consume. Some fish are available generally throughout the U.S., but others are more locally available, suggesting a need for site-specific information. This research was stakeholder driven, and reflected local interest in the safety of local fish. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among the fish, ranging from a mean of 0.03 microg/g (ppm-wet weight) for salmon (Salmo spp.) to 1.41 ppm for swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Maximum values for three species of fish (orange roughy Hoplostethus atianticus, swordfish walleye Sander vitreus) were over 1 ppm (FDA action level), and all of the fish except salmon had some values above 0.5 ppm, the action level set by some states and countries. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among three types of canned tuna (Thunnus spp): ""gourmet tuna"" had the least amount of mercury, and white tuna had the most. The mean concentrations reported in this study were generally similar to those reported by the FDA, but there were important differences: 1) although the mean mercury concentrations for orange roughy for the Chicago data was similar to the FDA data, the maximum concentration was higher; 2) the mean for the Chicago swordfish was higher than the FDA data (1.26 vs 0.97 ppm, methylmercury); 3) the maximum for tuna steaks was higher in the FDA data set; and, 4) mean values for grouper (Epinephelus spp.) were higher in the FDA data set than the Chicago data. Further, the FDA has virtually no data on walleye and none on ""gourmet tuna"".

16569057,"During routine analysis of commercial fish on halogenated pollutants, an unknown tribromo component (TriBHD) was initially detected as an abundant peak in sample extracts from the Mediterranean Sea. The molecular formula was established to be C16H19Br3O by gas chromatography with electron ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/EI-HRMS). GC/EI-MS data were virtually identical with a polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivative (PBHD) previously isolated from an Australian sponge species known to occur in the Mediterranean Sea as well. A tetrabromo isomer (TetraBHD) was also found in the fish samples. The concentrations of TriBHD and other halogenated compounds in commercial fish (sea bass, gilt head bream, anchovy, sardine, and salmon) were estimated with GC/electron capture detection (ECD). Using the ECD response of trans-nonachlor, the concentration of TriBHD reached up to 90 ng/g lipid weight and accounted for up to >90% of the concentration of p,p'-DDE, which was the most abundant peak in the most samples investigated. On the basis of the GC/ECD response, TetraBHD amounted for approximately 1/7 of TriBHD in all fish samples investigated. The sample with the highest content was a green-lipped mussel from New Zealand (236 ng/g lipid weight). The halogenated natural products TBA, Q1, and MHC-1 were also present in most of the samples. We assume that the bulk of the residues in fish from aquaculture may originate from algae and sponges living in proximity of the fish farms.

16488491,"Pesticide pulses in the Sacramento River, California, originate from storm-water discharges and non-point source aquatic pollution that can last from a few days to weeks. The Sacramento River and its tributaries have historically supported the majority of California's Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning grounds. Three pesticides currently used in the Sacramento Valley-- dinoseb, diazinon, and esfenvalerate-- were chosen to model the exposure of salmon embryos to storm-water discharges. Static-renewal (96 h) exposures to eyed eggs and alevins resulted in both toxicity and significant changes in metabolism assessed in whole-embryo extracts by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy based metabolomics and HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The 96-h LC(50) values of eyed eggs and alevins exposed to dinoseb were 335 and 70.6 ppb, respectively, and the corresponding values for diazinon were 545 and 29.5 ppm for eyed eggs and alevins, respectively. The 96-h LC(50) of eyed eggs exposed to esfenvalerate could not be determined due to lack of mortality at the highest exposure concentration, but in alevins was 16.7 ppb. All esfenvalerate exposed alevins developed some degree of lordosis or myoskeletal abnormality and did not respond to stimulus or exhibit normal swimming behavior. ATP concentrations measured by HPLC-UV decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb and 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate (p < 0.05). Phosphocreatine, as measured by HPLC-UV, decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb, 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate, and 100 ppm diazinon (p < 0.05). Principal components analyses of (1)H NMR metabolite fingerprints of eyed egg and alevin extracts revealed both dose-dependent and mechanism of action-specific metabolic effects induced by the pesticides. Furthermore, NMR based metabolomics proved to be more sensitive than HPLC-UV in identifying significant changes in sublethal metabolism of pesticide exposed alevins. In conclusion, we have demonstrated several benefits of a metabolomics approach for chemical risk assessment, when used in conjunction with a fish embryo assay, and have identified significant metabolic perturbations to the early life stages of Chinook salmon by currently used pesticides.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D019297', 'D000244', 'D000255', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D003976', 'D004625', 'D007928', 'D008141', 'D009682', 'D009570', 'D010575', 'D010725', 'D025341', 'D011722', 'D018570', 'D012474', 'D014874']","['2,4-Dinitrophenol', 'Adenosine Diphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diazinon', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Lordosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Nitriles', 'Pesticides', 'Phosphocreatine', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Pyrethrins', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salmon', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Metabolic effects of dinoseb, diazinon and esfenvalerate in eyed eggs and alevins of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) determined by 1H NMR metabolomics.","['Q000031', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000662', 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000139', 'Q000379', 'Q000633', 'Q000633', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000379', 'Q000196', 'Q000633']","['analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'veterinary', 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'chemically induced', 'methods', 'toxicity', 'toxicity', 'analysis', None, 'toxicity', 'methods', 'embryology', 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16488491,2007

The method is also a useful screen for histamine (HTA). The method involves homogenization of fish tissue, extraction of biogenic amines into borate-trichloroacetic acid solution, centrifugation, and derivatization of supernatant with 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester. The derivatized diamine species allow for the intramolecular excimer fluorescence of the pyrene moiety at a higher emission wavelength than is possible for the endogenous tissue monoamines, thus providing visual specificity of detection. All seafood species were fortified with 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 microg/g (ppm) of PUT and CAD.

Upon application of US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) methods for developing fish consumption advisories for cancer from mixtures of all of these substance for which USEPA has reported a cancer slope factor, the most stringent recommendation, for farmed salmon from northern Europe, was for consumption of at most one meal every 5 months in order to not exceed an elevated risk of cancer of more than 1 in 100,000. Farmed salmon from North and South America triggered advisories of between 0.4 and one meal per month. Retail market samples, in general, reflected levels found in regionally farmed fish, although much of the US salmon comes from Chile, which had somewhat lower contaminant levels than the North American farmed samples. Upon consideration of all of these organochlorine compounds as a mixture, even wild Pacific salmon triggered advisories of between one and less than five meals per month. The advisories are driven by the non-dioxin-like PCBs and pesticides and not by dioxins/furans and coplanar PCBs.

Calf thymus DNA was reacted with BPDE, digested enzymatically to nucleosides, and the major DNA adduct, 10-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (dG-BPDE), was purified by HPLC. Similar procedures were applied to prepare dG-BPDE-d8 from [1,2,3,4,5,6,11,12-(2)H8]BPDE for use as an internal standard. The HPLC-ES-MS/MS method was validated using a mixture of hydrolyzed salmon testis DNA (82 microg) and 10 pg dG-BPDE (analogous to 6.9 adducts/10(8) nucleotides). The results indicated an inter- and intraday accuracy of 99-100% and precision of 1.6-1.7% (relative standard deviation). When applied to a calf thymus DNA sample modified in vitro with [1,3-(3)H]BPDE, the method gave a value very similar to those obtained by radiolabeling, (32)P-postlabeling, and immunoassay. HPLC-ES-MS/MS analysis of hepatic DNA from mice treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 and 1.0 mg of [7,8-(3)H]BP gave values comparable to those determined by 32P-postlabeling and immunoassay. Lung DNA from mice fed a 0.3% coal tar diet (containing approximately 2 mg BP/g coal tar) for one month had 0.6 +/- 0.04 dG-BPDE adducts/10(8) nucleotides. This value is much lower than the 102 +/- 14 total DNA adducts/10(8) nucleotides determined by 32P-postlabeling, which suggests that dG-BPDE makes only a minor contribution to the DNA adducts formed in lung tissue of mice administered coal tar. The HPLC-ES-MS/MS method was used to assess human lung DNA samples for the presence of dG-BPDE. Based upon a limit of detection of 0.3 dG-BPDE adducts/10(8) nucleotides, when using 100 microg of DNA, dG-BPDE was detected in only 1 out of 26 samples. These observations indicate that HPLC-ES-MS/MS is suitable to assess the contribution of BP to DNA damage caused by exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixtures.

In this work, the suitability of anion-exchange CIM (Convective Interaction Media; BIA Separations, Ljubljana, Slovenia) monolithic columns for isolation of DNA from food was studied. Maize and its derivates corn meal and thermally pretreated corn meal were chosen as model food. Two commercially available CIM disk columns were tested: DEAE (diethylaminoethyl) and QA (quaternary amine). Preliminary separations were performed with standard solution of salmon DNA at different pH values and different NaCl concentrations in mobile phase. DEAE groups and pH 8 were chosen for further isolations of DNA from a complex matrix-food extract. The quality and quantity of isolated DNA were tested on agarose gel electrophoresis, with UV-scanning spectrophotometry, and by amplification with real-time PCR. DNA isolated in this way was of suitable quality for further PCR analyses. The described method is also applicable for DNA isolation from processed foods with decreased DNA content.

The addition of NOM to Cu exposures in ion-poor water always decreased Cu toxicity to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, approximately 1 g) over a 96-h period, and the degree of protection varied with respect to NOM source. A good correlation was found between the specific absorbance coefficient (SAC) and time to reach 50% mortality (LT50; p < 0.001), indicating that more optically dark, allochthonous-like NOM decreases Cu toxicity better than does optically light, more autochthonous-like NOM. A similar, good relationship between NOM source and Pb toxicity was seen (p < 0.001), once confounding effects of Ca binding to NOM were accounted for. No significant relationship between Cd toxicity and NOM optical quality was seen (p = 0.082), and in toxicity tests with Cd the presence of some of the NOM sources increased Cd toxicity compared to Cd-only controls. Specific absorbance coefficients were used as a proxy measurement of NOM aromaticity in our study, and fluorescence indices were run on some NOM samples to obtain percent aromaticity for each sample.

15549653,"Fish are the only major dietary source for humans of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) and with declining fisheries farmed fish such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) constitute an increasing proportion of the fish in the human diet. However, the current high use of fish oils, derived from wild capture marine fisheries, in aquaculture feeds is not sustainable in the longer term and will constrain continuing growth of aquaculture activities. Greater understanding of how fish metabolize and biosynthesize HUFA may lead to more sustainable aquaculture diets. The study described here contributes to an effort to determine the molecular genetics of the HUFA biosynthetic pathway in salmon, with the overall aim being to determine mechanisms for optimizing the use of vegetable oils in Atlantic salmon culture. In this paper we describe the cloning and functional characterization of 2 genes from salmon involved in the biosynthesis of HUFA. A salmon desaturase complementary DNA, SalDes, was isolated that include an open reading frame of 1362 bp specifying a protein of 454 amino acids. The protein sequence includes all the characteristics of microsomal fatty acid desaturases, including 3 histidine boxes, 2 transmembrane regions, and an N-terminal cytochrome b(5) domain containing a heme-binding motif similar to that of other fatty acid desaturases. Functional expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed SalDes is predominantly an omega-3 delta5 desaturase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) from alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). The desaturase showed only low levels of delta6 activity toward C(18) polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, a fatty acid elongase cDNA, SalElo, was isolated that included an open reading frame of 888 bp, specifying a protein of 295 amino acids. The protein sequence of SalElo included characteristics of microsomal fatty acid elongases, including a histidine box and a transmembrane region. Upon expression in yeast SalElo showed broad substrate specificity for polyunsaturated fatty acids with a range of chain lengths, with the rank order being C(18) > C(20) > C(22). Thus this one polypeptide product displays all fatty acid elongase activities required for the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) from 18:3n-3.","Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)","['D000123', 'D000595', 'D000818', 'D001483', 'D002849', 'D003001', 'D016000', 'D017931', 'D018076', 'D004281', 'D015118', 'D044943', 'D000081031', 'D040461', 'D015870', 'D008969', 'D010802', 'D012441', 'D020317', 'D016415', 'D017422', 'D017962']","['Acetyltransferases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Fatty Acid Elongases', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Salmo salar', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'alpha-Linolenic Acid']",Molecular cloning and functional characterization of fatty acyl desaturase and elongase cDNAs involved in the production of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids from alpha-linolenic acid in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).,"['Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000096', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378']","['genetics', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'biosynthesis', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15549653,2005

The fresh homogenised sample was subjected to microwave-assisted dissolution by sodium hydroxide in ethanol, which dissolved the sample and quantitatively oxidised arsenite (As(III)) to arsenate (As(V)). This allowed for the determination of inorganic arsenic as a single species, i.e. As(V), by anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS. The completeness of the oxidation was verified by recovery of As(V) which was added to the samples as As(III) prior to the dissolution procedure. The full recovery of As(V) at 104 +/- 7% (n = 5) indicated good analytical accuracy. The uncertified inorganic arsenic content in the certified reference material TORT-2 was 0.186 +/- 0.014 ng g(-1) (n = 6). The method was employed for the determination of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic in 60 fish samples including salmon from fresh and saline waters and in plaice. The majority of the results for inorganic arsenic were lower than the LOD of 3 ng g(-1), which corresponded to less than one per thousand of the total arsenic content in the fish samples.

These data suggest that excision of bands from gels is a simple procedure for the preparation of species-specific antisera, and confirm that cross-species assays give highly variable results.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

12628372,"This study was carried out to reveal some characteristics of cationic proteins from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) milt chromatin and to investigate their ability to activate Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) macrophages. Cationic proteins extracted from cod milt chromatin were fractionated on a cation exchange chromatography column. SDS-PAGE and amino acid analyses of the resulting fractions indicated that these proteins are similar to calf thymus histones. Two cationic protein fractions were used to stimulate leucocytes from Atlantic salmon in vitro and in vivo. Increased production of superoxide, measured as reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), was used as indication of macrophage activation. Both fractions induced elevated superoxide anion production in the macrophages after 3 and 6 days of in vitro stimulation. Intraperitoneal injection of the cationic protein fractions in Atlantic salmon (100 mg kg(-1)) four days prior to slaughtering stimulated superoxide production when assayed after one and two days of cell cultivation. In macrophages from fish slaughtered two days after injection, activation could first be seen after two days of cell cultivation.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

12351155,"We are working to understand possible human health effects from exposure to heterocyclic amines that are formed in meat during cooking. Laboratory-cooked beef, pork, and chicken are capable of producing tens of nanograms of MeIQx, IFP, and PhIP per gram of meat and smaller amounts of other heteroyclic amines. Well-done restaurant-cooked beef, pork, and chicken may contain PhIP and IFP at concentrations as high as tens of nanograms per gram and MeIQx at levels up to 3 ng/g. Although well-done chicken breast prepared in the laboratory may contain large amounts of PhIP, a survey of flame-grilled meat samples cooked in private homes showed PhIP levels in beef steak and chicken breast are not significantly different (P=0.36). The extremely high PhIP levels reported in some studies of grilled chicken are not seen in home-cooked samples.Many studies suggest individuals may have varying susceptibility to carcinogens and that diet may influence metabolism, thus affecting cancer susceptibility. To understand the human metabolism of PhIP, we examined urinary metabolites of PhIP in volunteers following a single well-done meat exposure. Using solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS, we quantified four major PhIP metabolites in human urine. In addition to investigating individual variation, we examined the interaction of PhIP with a potentially chemopreventive food. In a preliminary study of the effect of broccoli on PhIP metabolism, we fed chicken to six volunteers before and after eating steamed broccoli daily for 3 days. Preliminary results suggest that broccoli, which contains isothiocyanates shown to induce Phases I and II metabolism in vitro, may affect both the rate of metabolite excretion and the metabolic products of a dietary carcinogen.

Retinal (RAL1) or both RAL1 and 3,4-didehydroretinal (RAL2) were major or exclusive retinoids in the eggs of every species examined. In O. keta eggs, both RAL1 and RAL2 were present at the ratio of approximately 3:4, whereas RAL1 was the only retinal in the eggs of the other three marine species. RAL1 was the exclusive retinoid in the eggs of P. yokohamae and I. japonicus, whose eggs lack lipid bodies. In the eggs of O. keta and A. schlegeli, which have lipid bodies, retinylesters were also detected, and retinals composed 69% and 93%, respectively, of total retinoids. In O. keta eggs, retinals were present mostly in the aqueous part and were bound to a protein homologous to lipovitellin 1, an amphibian yolk protein, and retinylesters were located in lipids. These results indicate that retinals are the essential mode of retinoid storage in eggs of teleosts and they are the precursors of functional retinoids, such as retinoic acid and visual pigment chromophores.

11754018,"A pepstatin A-sensitive enzyme involved in yolk formation was purified from the masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) ovary using in vitro generation of yolk proteins from purified vitellogenin to assay enzymatic activity. Purification of the enzyme involved precipitation of ovarian extracts by water and ammonium sulfate followed by five steps of column chromatography. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, the purified enzyme appeared as a single approximately 42 kDa band that was immunoreactive to anti-human cathepsin D. The course of proteolytic cleavage of the three major yolk proteins (lipovitellin, beta'-component, and phosvitin) in fertilized masu salmon and Sakhalin taimen (Hucho perryi) eggs and embryos was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antisera. Major yolk protein bands appeared in positions corresponding to 92 kDa, 68 kDa, and 22 kDa (lipovitellin-derived peptides), as well as 17 kDa (beta'-component). During embryo development, the 92 kDa and 22 kDa bands gradually decreased in intensity, becoming undetectable in alevins. The 68 kDa band and a minor 24 kDa band became more intense after the eyed stage. Two additional peptides, corresponding to 40 and 28 kDa, newly appeared in alevins.

The unique DNA adduct was formed following the incubation of several Fusarium verticillioides isolates from the US and South Africa, while extracts of cultures of Fusarium graminearium and Fusarium sacchari isolates formed very little of the DNA adduct when incubated with DNA and S9.

10920350,"Many Salmo trutta populations consist of non-anadromous (freshwater-resident) brown trout and anadromous (sea-run migratory) sea trout. Although adult brown trout and sea trout can usually be identified using differences in size and body colouration, it is not possible to easily identify eggs/alevins as the progeny of brown trout or sea trout. In this study we show that delta(13)C and delta(15)N, measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS), can accurately identify fish eggs as the progeny of freshwater-resident (delta(13)C(egg) = -25.7 +/- 1.9 per thousand,delta(15)N(egg) = 9.2 +/- 1.8 per thousand) or migratory (delta(13)C(egg) = -19.9 +/- 1.1 per thousand, delta(15)N(egg) = 14. 3 +/- 1.5 per thousand) adult female Salmo trutta. Case studies show that stable isotope analysis is a more reliable technique for distinguishing anadromous adult fish than differentiation using morphological characteristics. For example, stable isotope analysis of brown trout from Loch Eck, Scotland, revealed that some individuals possessed delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures indicative of marine feeding despite visual identification as freshwater-resident fish. It is most likely that these fish are misidentified sea trout although it possible that these fish may be brown trout that have adopted an estuarine feeding strategy to avoid interspecific competition for food within Loch Eck with salmon, powan and Arctic charr. Most stable isotope studies of fish ecology use terminal tissue sampling to provide sufficient biological material for isotopic analysis; however, our study suggests that adipose fin tissue could provide a comparable measure of delta(13)C and delta(15)N.

Recently, two cDNAs encoding proteins, STC-1 and STC-2, homologous to fish STC have been identified in humans and rodents. The STC-1, but not STC-2, is identical to fish STC with respect to location of all Cys residues. The present study reports the localization of inter- and intra-molecular disulfide linkages in chum salmon STC. The chum salmon STC was deglycosylated and digested with several proteases in series. Six fragments, each of which consisted of two peptides connected by a single disulfide bond, were isolated by HPLC. Disulfide bonds were determined by sequence analysis after reduction and S-alkylation of each peptide fragment. Chum salmon STC is a homodimer connected by a single intermonomeric disulfide bond at Cys169. The monomer consists of 179 amino-acids, containing five intramonomeric disulfide bonds formed between Cys12-Cys26, Cys21-Cys41, Cys32-Cys81, Cys65-Cys95, and Cys102-Cys137.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D003545', 'D019281', 'D004220', 'D010450', 'D006023', 'D006031', 'D006728', 'D006801', 'D008969', 'D017685', 'D010446', 'D011487', 'D012474', 'D016415', 'D013329']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cysteine', 'Dimerization', 'Disulfides', 'Endopeptidases', 'Glycoproteins', 'Glycosylation', 'Hormones', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncorhynchus keta', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Protein Conformation', 'Salmon', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",Assignment of disulfide linkages in chum salmon stanniocalcin.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10198206,1999

The primary structure of this 37-amino acid peptide was established as follows: ACNTA TCVTH RLADF LSRSG GIGNS NFVPT NVGSK AF-NH2. The peptide shows close structural similarities to other nonmammalian (3-4 amino acid substitutions) and mammalian (5-8 amino acid substitutions) CGRPs, and it contains the two residues Asp14 and Phe15 that seem to be characteristic for CGRP in nonmammalian vertebrates. Cod CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited the motility of spontaneously active ring preparations from the cod intestine and was significantly (P < 0.05) more potent than rat alpha-CGRP. Neither prostaglandins nor nitric oxide is involved in the inhibitory response produced by cod CGRP, and the lack of effect of tetrodotoxin suggests an action of CGRP on receptors on the intestinal smooth muscle cells. The competitive CGRP antagonist human alpha-CGRP-(8-37) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the response to cod CGRP.

The purified enzyme was a monomeric protein having the molecular mass of 76 kDa. It promoted incorporation of monodansyl-cadaverine into chorion protein and catalyzed the polymerization of chorion subunit proteins. The effect of various reagents suggested that the chorion TGase is a Ca2+-dependent SH-enzyme similar to the well-characterized TGases of various animals. The highest activity was observed at pH 6.0. The amines examined in the present study inhibited the TGase activity of the purified enzyme. However, they did not necessarily cause effective inhibition of its activity. These properties of the chorion TGase were essentially consistent with our previous observations on polymerization of chorion proteins, resulting in chorion hardening.

The allergens of cod fish and particularly the major allergen parvalbumin beta (Gadus callarias) have been extensively studied in Norway. In the present communication, the white muscle parvalbumin was similarly found to be a major allergen in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, Sal sl). A purified salmon parvalbumin was obtained by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the muscle extracts. The antigenicity and allergenicity of salmon parvalbumin were confirmed using various immunologic and electrophoretic techniques. The protein is representative for several isoallergens judged by the amino acid (AA) sequence variance at certain sites in the AA sequence of CNBr cleavage peptides. Using sera from patients with cod and salmon allergy Sal sl was demonstrated to be the major allergen of Atlantic salmon, as judged by RAST- and ELISA-inhibitions and crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) techniques. The protein was also demonstrated to be antigenic by the use of polyclonal cod and salmon antibodies in IgG ELISA and immunoelectrophoretic methods. Cloning of parvalbumin cDNA from Atlantic salmon was performed based on an alignment of parvalbumin AA sequences from other species. A probe was generated by PCR and used for screening a salmon muscle cDNA-library. Subcloning and sequencing of two hybridizing clones revealed transcripts from two different parvalbumin genes.

8823929,"A previously published liquid chromatographic (LC) method for determining residues of flumequine (FLU) and nalidixic (NAL), oxolinic (OXO), and piromidic (PIR) acids in catfish tissue was applied to salmon and shrimp muscle. Identities of all 4 residues in salmon and shrimp were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The tissue is homogenized with acetone, the acetone extract is defatted with hexane, and the quinolones are extracted into chloroform. The extract is further purified by first partitioning into base and then back-extracting from a solution acidified to pH 6.0. Analytes are determined by LC with simultaneous UV and fluorescence detection. Muscle tissue was fortified with each quinolone at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 ng/g. Average recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSDs) for salmon, which represent an average of the 5 levels for each analyte, ranged from 75.9 to 90.8% and from 2.25 to 6.40%, respectively. Average recoveries and RSDs for shrimp ranged from 81.3 to 91.2% and from 7.34 to 10.7%, respectively.

7549088,"Previously, we reported that induction of peroxidation of synthetic phosphatidylcholines (PCs) containing a polyunsaturated fatty acid by Fe(2+)-EDTA in the presence of ascorbate resulted in the formation of four types of PCs with an sn-2-oxidatively fragmented acyl group, which had platelet-aggregating activity due to interaction with platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors. These PCs were compounds with a short-chain monocarboxylate, omega-hydroxymonocarboxylate, dicarboxylate, and dicarboxylate semialdehyde residue, respectively. In this study, we investigated the PAF-like lipids formed during peroxidation of PCs from hen egg yolk, salmon roe, sea urchin eggs, and krill in an FeSO4/EDTA/ascorbate system. The platelet-aggregating activities of these oxidized PCs were all inhibited by FR-900452, an antagonist of PAF. The activity of oxidized krill PC, which was equivalent of 89.8 +/- 8.8 pmol 16:0-PAF/mumol of starting PC, was about 5 times those of oxidized PCs from salmon roe and sea urchin eggs, and about 50 times that of oxidized hen egg yolk PC. The PAF-like phospholipids that had different combinations of long-chain alkyl or acyl groups with one of the above four types of short-chain acyl groups were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated that foodstuffs that are rich in 1-O-alkyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine are potential sources of compounds with high PAF-like activity formed by deleterious lipid peroxidation.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000818', 'D003445', 'D004530', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005502', 'D008401', 'D015394', 'D010053', 'D010063', 'D010084', 'D010713', 'D010743', 'D010972', 'D012474', 'D012617']","['Animals', 'Crustacea', 'Egg Yolk', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Food', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Ovary', 'Ovum', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Phospholipids', 'Platelet Activating Factor', 'Salmon', 'Sea Urchins']",Platelet-activating factor (PAF)-like phospholipids formed during peroxidation of phosphatidylcholines from different foodstuffs.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7549088,1995

Two different molecular forms of gonadotropins, designated tGTH I and tGTH II, were isolated from an alcoholic extract of pituitary glands following ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC. Both tGTH I and tGTH II stimulated estradiol-17 beta and testosterone production in tuna ovarian follicles in vitro, although responses to tGTH II were significantly greater than those to tGTH I. Each gonadotropin consisted of alpha- and beta-subunits. tGTH I was stable in acidic conditions, whereas tGTH II dissociated into two subunits after acid treatment.

18965614,"An analytical method based on microwave decomposition and flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled to hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS) is described. This is used to differentiate arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) from organoarsenic compounds usually present in seafood. Without microwave digestion, direct analysis of urine by HGAAS gives the total concentration of As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA because organoarsenic compounds such as arsenobetaine, usually found in most seafood, are not reducible upon treatment with borohydride and therefore cannot be determined by using the hydride generation technique. The microwave oven digestion procedure with potassium persulfate and sodium hydroxide as decomposition reagents completely decomposes all arsenicals to arsenate and this can be measured by HGASS. Microwave decomposition parameters were studied to achieve efficient decomposition and quantitative recovery of arsenobetaine spiked into urine samples. The method is applied to the determination of urinary arsenic and is useful for the assessment of occupational exposure to arsenic without intereference from excess organoarsenicals due to the consumption of seafood. Analysis of urine samples collected from an individual who ingested some seafood revealed that organoarsenicals were rapidly excreted in urine. After the ingestion of a 500-g crab, a 10-fold increase of total urinary arsenic was observed, due to the excretion of organoarsenicals. The maximum arsenic concentration was found in the urine samples collected approximately between 4 to 17 hr after eating seafood. However, the ingestion of organoarsenic-containing seafoods such as crab, shrimp and salmon showed no effect on the urinary excretion of inorganic arsenic, MMA and DMA.",Talanta,[],[],Determination of urinary arsenic and impact of dietary arsenic intake.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18965614,2009

A second peptide of the neuropeptide Y family was identified in the trout brain and this component was structurally similar to peptide tyrosine-tyrosine previously isolated from frog intestine (six amino acid substitutions) and identical to a peptide isolated from the pancreas of the closely related species, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Coho salmon). Peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, with the same primary structure as the brain peptide, was also isolated from an extract of the trout stomach. The data indicate that a peptide analogous to mammalian neuropeptide Y is present in the brain of teleost fish and a peptide analogous to mammalian peptide tyrosine-tyrosine is present in brain, gastrointestinal tissue and pancreas.

Basic ethanol extraction, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in the isolation of a homogeneous glycoprotein that appears as a 46-kDa product under nonreducing conditions and as a 23-kDa product under reducing conditions after sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The glycoprotein is likely to be a homodimer composed of two subunits of 23 kDa each. Further characterization indicates homology to Australian eel, sockeye salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout stanniocalcin, and the glycoprotein is thus concluded to be stanniocalcin. Stanniocalcin-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the corpuscles of Stannius of the Atlantic cod, with a specific antiserum raised against purified chum salmon stanniocalcin. The physiological importance and the biological activity of chum salmon stanniocalcin was tested by evaluating its effect on intestinal calcium uptake by the Atlantic cod in vitro. The intestine was perfused, both vascularly and through the intestinal lumen, and the calcium mucosa-to-serosa flux was measured using 45Ca2+ as a tracer. Stanniocalcin decreased the intestinal calcium uptake in a dose-related manner by 13.5% and 22.4% at doses of 2.2 and 10.9 nM stanniocalcin, respectively.

3666420,"In order to examine the role of thyroid hormones during salmonid development, techniques were developed for quantitative extraction of thyroxine from eggs, whole embryos, and alevins of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) at various stages of development. Frozen eggs, embryos, alevins, or fry were homogenized in ice-cold methanol. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was washed with a mixture of chloroform and 0.05% CaCl2. The aqueous layer was lyophilized, and the residue was redissolved in barbital buffer for thyroxine radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serial dilutions of the egg or tissue extracts gave inhibition slopes that were parallel to that of the thyroxine standard in the RIA. Immunoreactivity of the extracts coeluted with thyroxine standard in reverse-phase HPLC on an ODS column. Recovery of thyroxine from egg and tissue extracts was estimated from the recovery of 125I-labeled thyroxine added to the initial homogenates. Thyroxine content of eggs just after fertilization was 4-5 ng/egg, and this level was maintained until hatching. A decrease in thyroxine content was seen during yolk absorption. Total thyroxine increased to about 10 ng/fish, a level higher than that in the unfertilized egg, at the time of complete yolk absorption, and decreased within 10 days to a low level of 1 ng/fish.

The shrimp ribonucleic acid was extracted from boiled whole shrimp (Peneaus indicus), and was isolated by salt precipitation and sequential chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and BioGel P-100. The allergenic material was identified as a ribonucleic acid based on the following criteria: a maximal absorption at 258 nm, failure to stain positively with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on slab gel electrophoresis, positive staining with ethidium bromide, co-migration with yeast tRNA on submerged gel electrophoresis in 1.5% Agarose M, and sensitivity to ribonuclease T2 and 0.3 M NaOH. Treatment with protease did not alter its allergenic activity. The RNA was capable of binding allergen-specific IgE in sera from two shrimp-sensitive patients, as demonstrated by microELISA and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) using antigen-coated nitrocellulose filter paper discs and purified 125I-labeled goat anti-human IgE. RNA isolated from shrimp by a conventional tRNA isolation procedure also had the ability to specifically bind IgE in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients. IgE antibodies to shrimp RNA did not recognize yeast tRNA or salmon testes DNA, and were not detected in sera of other subjects. The shrimp-derived RNA was further able to induce a reaginic response in mice. A combination of in vitro aminoacylation of shrimp tRNA and SPRIA resulted in the identification of the allergenic tRNA as tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA(Arg).

The modified deoxynucleosides were isolated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A single, major adduct (60-68% of the total modified deoxynucleosides) was formed when either BaP or BaP 7,8-dihydrodiol was incubated with sole liver microsomes and DNA. Although other minor BaP-DNA adducts were formed, none represented greater than 3% of the total adducts. The major adduct had a retention time on HPLC identical to that of the N2-[10 beta (7 beta, 8 alpha, 9 alpha-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene)yl]-deoxy-guanosine (7R-anti-BPDE/trans-dG) adduct formed when anti-BPDE, the ultimate carcinogen of BaP in mammals, was incubated with DNA. Analysis of the Bay region tetrols showed that only the 7 alpha, 8 beta, 9 beta, 10 alpha-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydroBaP, a hydrolysis product of the anti-BPDE, was formed when BaP was incubated with sole liver microsomes.

The ratio of tetrols of anti-BPDE/syn-BPDE was 2; however, the ratio of adducts of anti-BPDE/syn-BPDE was 20. Thus, the findings show that hepatic microsomes of English sole, a fish species having a high incidence of liver neoplasia in chemically contaminated estuaries, metabolized BaP and BaP 7,8-dihydrodiol stereoselectively to form predominantly the 7R-anti-BPDE/trans-dG adduct.",Biochemical pharmacology,"['D000818', 'D001564', 'D001580', 'D004247', 'D004101', 'D005399', 'D066298', 'D008862']","['Animals', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Benzopyrenes', 'DNA', 'Dihydroxydihydrobenzopyrenes', 'Fishes', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microsomes, Liver']",Benzo[a]pyrene metabolism and DNA adduct formation mediated by English sole liver enzymes.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4038451,1985
6326200,"Several studies indicate that increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the diet may lead to decreased incidence of thrombotic events. Most investigators agree that this is achieved by competitively inhibiting the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to thromboxane A2 in the platelets. The effect of high EPA-intake on the formation of prostacyclin is less clear. However, EPA is a good substrate for lipoxygenase enzymes which results in formation of hydroperoxy- and hydroxy-acids, and, in some cases, leukotrienes. The biological activities of the leukotrienes derived from arachidonic acid suggest that they mediate or modulate some symptoms associated with inflammatory and hypersensitivity reactions. In order to clarify the possible effect of dietary manipulation on inflammatory processes, leukotriene B5 (LTB5) was prepared and its biological activities assessed. LTB5 was biosynthesized by incubation EPA with glycogen-elicited polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from rabbits in the presence of the divalent cation ionophore, A23187.

866128,"Salmons of two different sizes (group I; 22--30 g, group II; 600--1450 g) were tested for ethoxyquin (EMQ) residues after fed ad libitum a diet supplied with the therapeutic level of 900 ppm EMQ for 2 months. The sums of residues of EMQ and possible metabolites having similar fluorescence characteristics were determined by a fluorimetric method. The percentage of unmetabolized EMQ present was estimated using a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GLC-MS) method measuring only unchanged EMQ. For both methods the detection limit was 0.1 ppm. EMQ residues were also fluorimetrically estimated in muscle tissue of small salmons fed a diet preserved with 150 ppm EMQ for 2 months. At termination of feeding the diet supplied with 900 ppm EMQ, residues measured fluorimetrically in muscle tissue of salmons in both groups were averaging 0.7 ppm. Approximately one third was unchanged EMQ. From salmons of group II blood, kidney and hepatic tissue were also analyzed at termination of feeding and residues averaging 0.3, 0.8 and 1.8 ppm respectively were estimated. The elimination of EMQ from muscle tissue is illustrated in Fig. 1. No residues could be detected 9 days following termination of feeding the therapeutic level of EMQ. In muscle tissue of salmons fed the diet preserved with 150 ppm EMQ, residues ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 ppm of EMQ and possible metabolites were found in 9 of 10 samples obtained from 20 salmons in group I. For an evaluation of EMQ used as a feed additive (150 ppm), further studies were recommended. The diets used in the experiment contained 88 and 830 ppm EMQ respectively measured fluorimetrically at the end of the experiment. Approximately 88% of the residues in the feed was unchanged EMQ. It is suggested that most information regarding the hygienic aspects of residues in muscle tissue is obtained by fluorimetry which is therefore recommended for determination of EMQ residues in tissues. The GLC-MS method, however, is recommended for estimation of EMQ levels in feed.",Nordisk veterinaermedicin,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002849', 'D005015', 'D005470', 'D005527', 'D009132', 'D011804', 'D012474', 'D013997']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Ethoxyquin', 'Fluorometry', 'Food, Fortified', 'Muscles', 'Quinolines', 'Salmon', 'Time Factors']",Ethoxyquin (EMQ) residues in Atlantic salmon measured by fluorimetry and gas chromatography (GLC).,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/866128,1977
810771,"Responding to the recommendations of the Lake Michigan Interstate Pesticide Committee, the author aimed to establish baseline baseline data on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) and DDT in Lake Michigan fish in 1971. Because the past 2 years had witnessed unprecedented legislative action to protect food resources and other aquatic species near the top of the food chain from persistent hazardous chemicals, the author also attempted to gauge the impact of cooperative legislative action on the quality of large lakes. Thirteen species of fish taken from 14 regions of Lake Michigan in the fall of 1971 were analyzed for PCB's and DDT analogs. Mean wet-weight concentrations of PCB's similar to Aroclor 1254 ranged from 2.7 ppm in rainbow smelt to 15 ppm in lake trout. Most trout and salmon longer than 12 inches contained PCB's at concentrations greater than the tolerance level of 5 ppm established by the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare. Mean concentrations of total DDT ranged from less than 1 ppm in suckers to approximately 16 ppm in large lake trout. The presence of the major chlorinated hydrocarbons was confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; additional PCB confirmations were obtained through perchlorination. The most abundant PCB's were tetra, penta-, hexa-, and hepatchlorobiphenyls which are similar to commercially prepared Aroclor 1254; lesser chlorinated PCB's were present in fish from nearshore waters.",Pesticides monitoring journal,"['D000818', 'D002347', 'D002849', 'D003634', 'D005399', 'D005618', 'D006114', 'D010573', 'D011078', 'D012474', 'D014337']","['Animals', 'Carps', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'DDT', 'Fishes', 'Fresh Water', 'Great Lakes Region', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Salmon', 'Trout']","Baseline concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and DDT in Lake Michigan fish, 1971.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/810771,1976
