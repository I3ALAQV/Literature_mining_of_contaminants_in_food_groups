24313968,"Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a wide-spectrum antimicrobial compound found in mustard seeds, produced when their tissues are disrupted. The formation of AITC in mustard seed is mediated by the myrosinase enzyme which catalyzes the release of volatile AITC from a glucosinolate-sinigrin. Since water is a substrate in the reaction, humidity from the air can be used to activate the release of AITC from mustard seed. In this study, defatted and partially defatted mustard seed meals were ground into powders with particle size ranging from 5 to 300 μm. The mustard seed meal powder (MSMP) samples were enclosed within hermetically sealed glass jars wherein the headspace air was adjusted to 85% or 100% relative humidity at 5, 20, or 35 °C. Data from gas chromatography analysis showed that AITC release rate and amount increased with increasing relative humidity and temperature. Moreover, the release rate can be manipulated by particle size and lipid content of the MSMP samples. The amount of AITC released ranged from 2 to 17 mg/g MSMP within 24 h under the experimental conditions tested. In view of the antimicrobial properties of AITC, the mustard meal powder may be used as a natural antimicrobial material for extending the shelf life of food products.

22746294,"Roasting of high erucic mustard (HEM) seed has been reported to give a typical flavor and increase the oxidative stability of the extracted oil. A potent radical scavenging compound was successfully isolated from roasted HEM seed oil in a single-step chromatographic separation using an amino solid-phase extraction column. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectra revealed the compound as 2,6-dimethoxy-4-vinylphenol (generally known as canolol), and its identity was fully confirmed by chemical synthesis. The formation of canolol during roasting was compared among HEM varieties (Brassica juncea, B. juncea var. oriental, Brassica nigra, and Sinapis alba) together with a low erucic rapeseed variety. HEM varieties were shown to produce less than one-third of canolol compared to rapeseed at similar roasting conditions. This observation was linked to a lower free sinapic acid content together with a lower loss of sinapic acid derivatives in the HEM varieties compared to rapeseed. Around 50% of the canolol formed in the roasted seed was shown to be extracted in the oil. Roasting of HEM seed before oil extraction was found to be a beneficial step to obtain canolol-enriched oil, which could improve the oxidative stability.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D029741', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D005421', 'D005511', 'D016166', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D009149', 'D009390', 'D010636', 'D010938', 'D012639', 'D017365', 'D014753']","['Brassica rapa', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Handling', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mustard Plant', 'Nepal', 'Phenols', 'Plant Oils', 'Seeds', 'Spices', 'Vinyl Compounds']",Isolation and identification of a potent radical scavenger (canolol) from roasted high erucic mustard seed oil from Nepal and its formation during roasting.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000302']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22746294,2014
