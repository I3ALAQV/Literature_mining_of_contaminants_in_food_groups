35040126,"A combination of magnetic solid-phase extraction using an efficient and cheap magnetic sorbent obtained from sand and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction has been developed for the extraction of nine multiclass pesticides (clodinafop-propargyl, haloxyfop-R-methyl, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, oxadiazon, penconazole, diniconazole, chlorpyrifos, fenazaquin, and fenpropathrin) from commercial fruit juices (sour cherry, pomegranate, grape, watermelon, orange, apricot, and peach juices). The enriched pesticides were determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sorbent was natural iron oxide entrapped in silica along with some impurities. In this method, to extract the analytes from the samples, an appropriate amount of the magnetic sorbent (at mg level) is added. Then the sorbent particles are isolated from the solution using an external magnetic field and the adsorbed analytes are desorbed from the sorbent by acetone. In the following, a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure is carried out to concentrate the analytes more and to reach low limits of detection.",Journal of the science of food and agriculture,[],[],Improved magnetic solid-phase extraction based on magnetic sorbent obtained from sand for the extraction of pesticides from fruit juice.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35040126,2022

34883355,"Facile and sensitive determination of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in food samples is important but still remains great challenge. Herein, a pipette tip solid phase extraction (PT-SPE) method was developed for fast and sensitively detecting PGRs. The PT-SPE adsorbent was prepared by integrating a novel covalent organic framework (COF) of schiff base network 3 (SNW-3) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) through electrospinning. The SNW-3 can easily adsorb PGRs with high special affinity through electrovalent bands between the ammonium ions of SNW-3 and the carboxy groups of PGRs. The polymer of PAN acts as scaffold material for SNW-3, which can lower seepage pressure hence accelerates adsorption/desorption kinetics. By combination with HPLC-DAD, a satisfactory method was successfully developed for simultaneous determination of ten PGRs in watermelon. Good analytical performances were achieved with this proposed method, including good linearity (5-500 ng/mL) with high correlation coefficients (R ≥ 0.9981), low limits of detection (S/N = 3, 0.24-3.19 ng/mL) and limits of quantification (S/N = 10, 1.65-5.72 ng/mL), satisfactory precision (intra-day RSDs ≤ 2.7%, inter-day RSDs ≤ 3.7%), and high accuracy (recovery: 82.8-113.0%).

Low-cost, environmentally friendly, effective seed treatment remain to be optimized and tested for high-value specialty crop like watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in multi-locations. This remains a particularly acute problem for triploids, which produce desirable seedless watermelons, but show low germination rates. In the present study, turmeric oil nanoemulsions (TNE) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from agro-industrial byproducts were used as nanopriming agents for diploid (Riverside) and triploid (Maxima) watermelon seeds. Internalization of nanomaterials was confirmed by neutron activation analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The seedling emergence rate at 14 days after sowing was significantly higher in AgNP-treated triploid seeds compared to other treatments. Soluble sugar (glucose and fructose) contents were enhanced during germination in the AgNP-treated seeds at 96 h. Seedlings grown in the greenhouse were transplanted at four locations in Texas: Edinburg, Pecos, Grapeland, and Snook in 2017. At Snook, higher yield 31.6% and 35.6% compared to control were observed in AgNP-treated Riverside and Maxima watermelons, respectively. To validate the first-year results, treated and untreated seeds of both cultivars were sown in Weslaco, Texas in 2018. While seed emegence and stand establishments were enhanced by seed priming, total phenolics radical-scavenging activities, and macro- and microelements in the watermelon fruits were not significantly different from the control.

Reaction time and reagent concentration for these assays were optimized using leaves from spinach, kale, collards, mustard, and watermelon. Further, these assays were validated for linearity and intra-assay precision. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS) was used for phytochemical profiling and studying relative abundances of certain phenolic compounds in various leaf discs suspended and cell-free extracts. The mass spectral analysis showed that leaf disc suspended methanolic extracts had almost same phytochemical profiles to those of cell-free extracts. The DPPH leaf disc assay demonstrated better radical scavenging potential than the conventional cell-free extract method. By contrast, the observed antioxidant activity values in ABTS and PPR leaf disc assays were lower than those of conventional cell-free extract-based methods.

30756297,"Because of accruing oxidative stress with advancing age, older adults may benefit from increased dietary intake of lycopene, a lipophilic carotenoid with potent antioxidant properties. Yet, intake of dietary lycopene as well as circulating lycopene levels are known to decrease with aging. Watermelon is one of the few food sources of dietary lycopene. Because heat treatment increases lycopene bioavailability, ingestion of watermelon in pasteurized juice form may be an optimal delivery vehicle to increase lycopene levels in older adults. However, due to its lipophilic nature, there are concerns that co-ingestion of dietary fat may be necessary for efficient intestinal absorption of lycopene. Thus, this feasibility study aimed to examine the effects of a one-time dose of 100% pasteurized watermelon juice on circulating lycopene concentrations of postmenopausal women after a 10-h overnight fast. Blood was sampled from eight women before and 2 h after ingestion of 360 ml of juice, and serum lycopene was measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Circulating lycopene levels increased by three-fold (p < 0.001) with increases observed for every participant. Results demonstrate that 100% watermelon juice is a palatable, effective means of increasing serum lycopene in older adult women, a group at risk for low carotenoid intake.

28040679,"Watermelon is an important and economical horticultural crop in China, where ~20% of the plants are grafted. The development of grafted watermelon fruit involves a diverse range of gene interactions that results in dynamic changes in fruit. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying grafting-induced fruit quality change are unclear. In the present study, we measured the lycopene content by high-performance liquid chromatography and used RNA-Seq (quantification) to perform a genome-wide transcript analysis of fruits from watermelon grafted onto pumpkin rootstock (pumpkin-grafted watermelon, PGW), self-grafted watermelon (SGW), and non-grafted watermelon (NGW). The results showed variation in the lycopene content in the flesh of PGW fruits, first increasing and then decreasing in the four stages, which was different from the trend in the flesh of NGW and SGW fruits. The transcriptome profiling data provided new information on the grafting-induced gene regulation of lycopene biosynthesis during fruit growth and development. The expression levels of 33 genes from 8 gene families (GGPS, PSY, PDS, ZDS, CRTISO, LCYb, LCYe, and CHY) related to lycopene biosynthesis, which play critical roles in fruit coloration and contribute significantly to fruit phytonutrient values, were monitored during the four periods of fruit development in watermelon. Compared with those of NGW and SGW, 14 genes were differentially expressed in PGW during fruit development, suggesting that these genes possibly help to mediate lycopene biosynthesis in grafted watermelon fruit.

The AgNPs exhibited strong broad spectrum antibacterial activity against five different foodborne bacteria with zones of inhibition 9.12-14.54mm in diameter. When AgNPs were mixed with kanamycin and rifampicin the mixture exhibited strong antibacterial synergistic activity. The AgNPs also exerted strong synergistic anticandidal activity when they were combined with amphotericin b. The AgNPs had high antioxidant activity and reducing power. Overall, the results confirmed the bio-potentials of the synthesized AgNPs using WRA, which could have applications in the biomedical, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food preservation and packaging industries.

26669648,"Provitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin) contribute to the dietary intake of vitamin A and are associated with decreased risk of many chronic diseases. Besides their contents in foods, their bioaccessibility is of great interest since it represents the amount that will be absorbed in the gut. The aim of this study was to adopt, for the first time, the in vitro digestion model suitable for food, proposed in a consensus paper by Minekus et al. (2014), to assess the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the fruits that are the major contributors to the intake of β-cryptoxanthin in Spain (orange, tangerine, red pepper, peach, watermelon, and persimmon) and loquat. The highest β-cryptoxanthin content and the lowest bioaccessibility was found in mandarin and loquat (13331.6 and 929.2 μg per 100 g respectively), whereas the highest contents of β-carotene and α-carotene were recorded in red pepper (1135.3 and 90.4 μg per 100 g respectively). The bioaccessibility of β-cryptoxanthin was similar to that of β-carotene (0.02-9.8% and 1-9.1%, respectively) and was higher than that of β-carotene in red pepper, watermelon and peach. α-Carotene bioaccessibility ranged between 0% and 4.6%. We discuss the critical factors for comparing our data: the form of the food being analyzed (raw/cooked/previously frozen, in the presence or absence of oil/fat) and the protocol for bioaccessibility assessment. Different food processing techniques may increase carotenoid bioaccessibility compared to raw food. However, given the difficulties encountered when comparing the results of studies on bioaccessibility, it seems logical to propose the application of the previously mentioned standardized in vitro protocol.

26664116,"Biological synthesis of nanoparticles using nontoxic, eco-friendly approaches is gaining importance owing to their fascinating biocompatibility and environmentally benign nature. This study describes the green synthesis approach for synthesis of gold nanoparticles (ANPs) using aqueous extract of the rind of watermelon as a fruit waste and evaluate its biopotential in terms of proteasome inhibitory activity, antibacterial, and antioxidant potential. The synthesized ANPs were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface plasmon resonance spectra of ANPs were obtained at 560 nm. Scanning electron microscopy image revealed that particles had a spherical shape and have a size distribution of 20-140 nm, followed by the elemental analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the crystallite nature of the ANPs and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the involvement of bioactive compounds from watermelon rind in the synthesis, capping, and stabilization of ANPs. ANPs exhibited potential antibacterial activity against five different foodborne pathogenic bacteria with diameter of inhibition zones ranged between 9.23 and 11.58 mm. They also displayed strong synergistic antibacterial activity together with kanamycin (11.93-21.08 mm inhibition zones) and rifampicin (10.32-24.84 mm inhibition zones). ANPs displayed strong antioxidant activity in terms of DPPH radical scavenging (24.69%), nitric oxide scavenging (25.62%), ABTS scavenging (29.42%), and reducing power. Significantly high proteasome inhibitory potential of the ANPs (28.16%) could be highly useful for cancer treatment and targeted cancer drug delivery. Overall, results highlight a potential low-cost green method of synthesizing ANPs from food waste materials. Significant biopotentials of synthesized ANPs could make it a potential candidate for its application in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food sectors.

Many separation methods have been reported for extracting lycopene from its sources. The inclusion complex is an effective method for extraction and purification of organic chemicals. This procedure has 2 main components: host and guest molecules. In this study, lycopene (guest) was extracted from tomato paste by ursodeoxycholic acid, the inclusive agent (host). The molecular structure of the extracted lycopene was then confirmed by (1) HNMR and its purity was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography and UV-Vis spectrophotometry methods, in comparison with a standard product.

23973661,"In order to broaden the available genetic variation of melon, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate mutation library in an orange-flesh 'Charentais' type melon line that accumulates β-carotene. One mutagenized M2 family segregated for a novel recessive trait, a yellow-orange fruit flesh ('yofI'). HPLC analysis revealed that 'yofI' accumulates pro-lycopene (tetra-cis-lycopene) as its major fruit pigment. The altered carotenoid composition of 'yofI' is associated with a significant change of the fruit aroma since cleavage of β-carotene yields different apocarotenoids than the cleavage of pro-lycopene. Normally, pro-lycopene is further isomerized by CRTISO (carotenoid isomerase) to yield all-trans-lycopene, which is further cyclized to β-carotene in melon fruit. Cloning and sequencing of 'yofI' CRTISO identified two mRNA sequences which lead to truncated forms of CRTISO. Sequencing of the genomic CRTISO identified an A-T transversion in 'yofI' which leads to a premature STOP codon. The early carotenoid pathway genes were up regulated in yofI fruit causing accumulation of other intermediates such as phytoene and ζ-carotene. Total carotenoid levels are only slightly increased in the mutant. Mutants accumulating pro-lycopene have been reported in both tomato and watermelon fruits, however, this is the first report of a non-lycopene accumulating fruit showing this phenomenon.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,"['D053898', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D028463', 'D005020', 'D000077276', 'D016296', 'D019207', 'D019745']","['Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis melo', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate', 'Lycopene', 'Mutagenesis', 'beta Carotene', 'cis-trans-Isomerases']",Genetic and chemical characterization of an EMS induced mutation in Cucumis melo CRTISO gene.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['genetics', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23973661,2014
23909654,"The behavioral responses of foraging adults of Kallima inachus (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) to four colors and to six different fermented fruit juices were observed in order to determine the cues used by foraging adults. According to the results, adults did not show a behavioral response to red, yellow, purple, or white artificial flowers without food odors, but flowers with the fermented pear juice strongly attracted them, and they showed a behavioral response to fermented juices of the six fruits (pear, apple, banana, watermelon, orange, and persimmon) with no statistically significant preference. The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate. The EAG responses of naive adults showed that the EAG responses to 3-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were all higher than those to ethanol (100%) at doses of either 5 µl/mL or 50 µl/mL. Sexual differences only existed in 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetic acid at particular concentrations. Sexual differences in response to chemical mixtures were not significant at 50 µl/mL. In addition, the EAG responses in the within-sex trials were not correlated to the dosage (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and µl/mL) of either ethanol or ethyl acetate.

23314817,"Chromoplasts are unique plastids that accumulate massive amounts of carotenoids. To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya. The comparative analysis of chromoplast proteins among six crop species offers new insights into the general metabolism and function of chromoplasts as well as the uniqueness of chromoplasts in specific crop species.

21259065,"Wild watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a xerophyte native to the Kalahari Desert, Africa. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in this plant, we examined changes in the proteome in response to water deficit. Wild watermelon leaves showed decreased transpiration and a concomitant increase in leaf temperature under water deficit conditions. Comparison of the proteome of stressed plants with that of unstressed plants by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the intensity of 40 spots increased in response to the stress, and the intensity of 11 spots decreased. We positively identified 23 stress-induced and 6 stress-repressed proteins by mass spectrometry and database analyses. Interestingly, 15 out of the 23 up-regulated proteins (65% of annotated up-regulated proteins) were heat shock proteins (HSPs). Especially, 10 out of the 15 up-regulated HSPs belonged to the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family. Other stress-induced proteins included those related to antioxidative defense and carbohydrate metabolism. Fifteen distinct cDNA sequences encoding the sHSP were characterized from wild watermelon. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the representative sHSP genes revealed strong transcriptional up-regulation in the leaves under water deficit. Moreover, immunoblot analysis confirmed that protein abundance of sHSPs was massively increased under water deficit. Overall, these observations suggest that the defense response of wild watermelon may involve orchestrated regulation of a diverse array of functional proteins related to cellular defense and metabolism, of which HSPs may play a pivotal role on the protection of the plant under water deficit in the presence of strong light.",Planta,"['D000221', 'D000975', 'D050260', 'D029773', 'D018076', 'D055864', 'D018506', 'D006360', 'D006358', 'D010802', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D018526', 'D020543', 'D020539', 'D015533']","['Adaptation, Ocular', 'Antioxidants', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Citrullus', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Droughts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Proteome', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Transcriptional Activation']","Dynamic changes in the leaf proteome of a C3 xerophyte, Citrullus lanatus (wild watermelon), in response to water deficit.","['Q000502', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000096', 'Q000502', 'Q000378', None, None]","['physiology', 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'genetics', 'biosynthesis', 'physiology', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21259065,2011
20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories.

20178389,"Research has suggested that lycopene may be metabolized by eccentric cleavage, catalyzed by beta-carotene oxygenase 2, resulting in the generation of apo-lycopenals. Apo-6'-lycopenal and apo-8'-lycopenal have been reported previously in raw tomato. We now show that several other apo-lycopenals are also present in raw and processed foods, as well as in human plasma. Apo-lycopenal standards were prepared by in vitro oxidation of lycopene, and a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in negative mode was developed to separate and detect the apo-6'-, apo-8'-, apo-10'-, apo-12'-, apo-14'-, and apo-15'-lycopenal products formed in the reaction. Hexane/acetone extracts of raw tomato, red grapefruit, watermelon, and processed tomato products were analyzed, as well as plasma of individuals who had consumed tomato juice for 8 weeks. Apo-6'-, apo-8'-, apo-10'-, apo-12'-, and apo-14'-lycopenals were detected and quantified in all food products tested, as well as plasma. The sum of apo-lycopenals was 6.5 microg/100 g Roma tomato, 73.4 microg/100 g tomato paste, and 1.9 nmol/L plasma. We conclude that several apo-lycopenals, in addition to apo-6'- and -8'-lycopenal, are present in lycopene-containing foods. In addition, the presence of apo-lycopenals in plasma may derive from the absorption of apo-lycopenals directly from food and/or human metabolism.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002338', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D000077276', 'D008297', 'D010936', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Lycopene', 'Male', 'Plant Extracts', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']","Identification and quantification of apo-lycopenals in fruits, vegetables, and human plasma.","['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20178389,2010

FODMAPs include lactose, fructose in excess of glucose, fructans and fructooligosaccharides (FOS, nystose, kestose), galactooligosaccharides (GOS, raffinose, stachyose), and sugar polyols (sorbitol, mannitol). This paper describes an analytical approach based on HPLC with ELSD that quantifies the major FODMAPs in 45 vegetables and 41 fruits.

18622950,"Controversy exists regarding the possible protective role of carotenoids against cancer. Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

The preparation of a supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) watermelon-lycopene extract could serve as a food grade source of this carotenoid. This study established preliminary conditions for enhancing SC-CO2 extraction of lycopene from watermelon. Freeze-dried watermelon was extracted with SC-CO2 and ethanol as an organic co-solvent. The lycopene concentration was determined by HPLC, with absorbance measured at 503 nm. In an initial set of experiments, the effects of extraction temperature (70-90 degrees C), pressure (20.7-41.4 MPa) and co-solvent ethanol addition (10-15%) were evaluated. A lycopene yield of 38 microg per gram of wet weight was obtained at 70 degrees C, 20.7 MPa, and 15% by volume ethanol. The extraction of fresh (non-freeze-dried) watermelon yielded 103+/-6 microg lycopene per gram fresh fruit weight. Of the parameters tested, temperature had the most effect on lycopene yield. Thus, in another set of experiments, the temperature was varied from 60-75 degrees C at an extraction pressure of 20.7 MPa in the presence of 15% ethanol.

Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and red wine were selected as the food sources containing meso-erythritol. The amount of meso-erythritol was calculated as 2.36 mg/100 g fresh weight of watermelon and 206.7 mg/L of red wine. The results obtained from the immunoassay are in close agreement with the reported values analyzed by HPLC and GC (22-24 mg/kg in watermelon and 130-300 mg/L in red wine). The recovery analyses showed that added amounts of meso-erythritol were recovered fairly accurately with recoveries of 86-105% (watermelon) and 85-93.3% (red wine).

Concentrations of (238)U, (235)U, (232)Th, (226)Ra, (222)Rn, (137)Cs and (40)K in nine soil profiles were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry whereas watermelon and zucchini crops were analyzed for their uranium content by means of alpha spectrometry after radiochemical separation. Correlations between measured radionuclides were made and their activity ratios were determined to evaluate their geochemical behavior in the soil profiles. Calculated soil-plant transfer factors indicate that the green parts (leaves, stems and roots) of the studied crops tend to accumulate uranium about two orders of magnitude higher than the fruits. The maximum dose from ingestion of 1 kg of watermelon pulp was estimated to be 3.1 and 4.7 nSv y(-1) for (238)U and (234)U, respectively.

As new physiological roles are discovered for some of the minor carotenoids that are found in only small amounts in present sources, the need for discovery of new sources will amplify. Thus, a method is needed that will effectively and gently concentrate carotenoids from potential new sources for subsequent identification and analysis. A procedure is presented by which carotenoid-containing tissue chromoplasts can be extracted and subsequently concentrated by precipitation, all in an aqueous milieu. The chromoplasts are extracted and solubilized with 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in water. The addition of a nominally equal volume of acetonitrile to the chromoplasts in SDS immediately precipitates the chromoplasts out of solution with generally >90% recovery. Carotenoids contained in the concentrated, still-intact chromoplasts can then be solubilized by organic solvent extraction for subsequent analysis.

This study was aimed at obtaining a method for nondestructive SSC detection of watermelons by means of visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) diffuse transmittance technique. Vis/NIR transmittance spectra of intact watermelons were acquired using a low-cost commercially available spectrometer operating over the range 350~1000 nm. Spectra data were analyzed by two multivariate calibration techniques: partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR) methods. Two experiments were designed for two varieties of watermelons [Qilin (QL), Zaochunhongyu (ZC)], which have different skin thickness range and shape dimensions. The influences of different data preprocessing and spectra treatments were also investigated. Performance of different models was assessed in terms of root mean square errors of calibration (RMSEC), root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient (r) between the predicted and measured parameter values. Results showed that spectra data preprocessing influenced the performance of the calibration models. The first derivative spectra showed the best results with high correlation coefficient of determination [r=0.918 (QL); r=0.954 (ZC)], low RMSEP [0.65 degrees Brix (QL); 0.58 degrees Brix (ZC)], low RMSEC [0.48 degrees Brix (QL); 0.34 degrees Brix (ZC)] and small difference between the RMSEP and the RMSEC by PLS method. The nondestructive Vis/NIR measurements provided good estimates of SSC index of watermelon, and the predicted values were highly correlated with destructively measured values for SSC.

Dried apricots and pureed rosehips contain relatively large amounts, too. In our study we found that passionflower fruit (skin and pericarp) contains a great amount of lycopene, whereas the content of other carotenoids is very low, and almost inexistent. This edible fruit could be an alternative source of a potential important nutrient for those people who do not eat tomatoes and tomato products.",Journal of medicinal food,"['D000975', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D000077276', 'D009747', 'D029598']","['Antioxidants', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Lycopene', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Passiflora']","Passionflower fruit-a ""new"" source of lycopene?","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857218,2005
15481257,"A new analytical method was developed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry for the routine analysis of 31 multi-class pesticide residues and applied to approximately 50 fresh fruit and vegetable samples (green bean, cucumber, pepper, tomato, eggplant, watermelon, melon and zucchini). Extraction of the pesticides with ethyl acetate was carried out. The optimal ionisation conditions were selected for each pesticide in the same run. The procedure was validated and the values of some merit figures, such as recovery, precision, linear range, detection limit and quantification limit for each pesticide were calculated together with its calculated expanded uncertainty (U). The average recoveries in cucumber obtained for each pesticide ranged between 74 and 105% at two different fortification levels (n = 10 each) that ranged between 9 and 250 ng g(-1) (depending on the pesticide). The uncertainty associated to the analytical method was lower than 23% for all compounds tested. The calculated limits of detection and quantitation were typically <1 ng g(-1) that were much lower than the maximum residue levels established by European legislation.",Journal of chromatography.

14994812,"Cucurbitacins are feeding stimulants for corn rootworm used in baits to control the adults of this insect pest. Corn rootworm larvae also feed compulsively on cucurbitacins. Cucurbitacins are reported to be gibberellin antagonists that may preclude their use as seed treatments for these soil-dwelling insects. The crude extract of a bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin E-glycoside significantly inhibited germination of watermelon, squash, and tomato seeds. Although the germination of corn seed was not significantly inhibited, root elongation was inhibited by crude extracts, but not by high-performance liquid chromatography-purified cucurbitacin E-glycoside. Therefore, the effects of the major components in the bitter watermelon extract (e.g., sugars) on seed germination and root elongation were determined. Pure sugars (glucose and fructose), at concentrations found in watermelon extract, mimicked the inhibition of seed germination and root elongation seen with the crude bitter Hawkesbury watermelon extract. Removal of these sugars may be necessary to use this extract as a bait for corn rootworm larvae as a seed or root treatment.",Journal of economic entomology,"['D000818', 'D029773', 'D001517', 'D028464', 'D054728', 'D018525', 'D018551', 'D010675', 'D010936', 'D018517', 'D012639', 'D014315', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Citrullus', 'Coleoptera', 'Cucurbita', 'Cucurbitacins', 'Germination', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Pheromones', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Roots', 'Seeds', 'Triterpenes', 'Zea mays']","Inhibition of seed germination by extracts of bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin, a feeding stimulant for corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).","[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000254', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000254', 'Q000254', 'Q000494', 'Q000254']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'growth & development', None, 'drug effects', 'growth & development', None, 'pharmacology', 'growth & development', 'growth & development', 'pharmacology', 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14994812,2004
12955396,"A wide range of pesticides used to control pests in vegetables have been determined in agricultural plant waste from beans, watermelons, and melons grown in greenhouses located in a predominantly agricultural area in Southeast Spain (Almería). Analysis of the pesticides was carried out by low-pressure gas chromatography (LP-GC) with mass spectrometry in tandem (MS-MS) mode, after extraction of the lyophilized samples with dichloromethane. The influence of the sample matrix on the analysis was avoided by use of matrix-matched standards. Linearity, detection limit ( LOD), quantitation limit ( LOQ), recovery, and precision for each pesticide were calculated. The most frequently encountered pesticides were endosulfan (>73% of the analyzed samples) and buprofezin (>55% of the samples), followed by cypermethrin, pirimifos-methyl, bifentrin, and chlorpyrifos (>30% of the samples).

12769528,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the rate of deterioration of lycopene in watermelon tissue during frozen storage, because little is known about the stability of watermelon tissue lycopene under cold storage conditions. Heart tissue from each of nine individual watermelons was stored at -20 or -80 degrees C as either small chunks or puree and periodically sampled over a year's time. Initial freeze-thaw experiments indicated that a small percentage of lycopene, approximately 4-6%, degraded during an initial freeze-thaw. Analyses of the samples showed a loss of approximately 30-40% lycopene over a year's storage at -20 degrees C and a loss of approximately 5-10% over the same period at -80 degrees C. Lycopene was slightly more stable in pureed compared with diced watermelon tissue at -20 degrees C, but not at -80 degrees C. The kinetic data were best fitted by application of two simultaneous, first-order decay processes. HPLC analysis of the samples after a year's storage suggested that beta-carotene was more stable during storage at -20 degrees C than was lycopene.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002338', 'D002851', 'D029773', 'D005511', 'D005615', 'D007700', 'D000077276', 'D013997']","['Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrullus', 'Food Handling', 'Freezing', 'Kinetics', 'Lycopene', 'Time Factors']",The effects of frozen storage conditions on lycopene stability in watermelon tissue.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None]","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12769528,2003
11303462,"Increased consumption of tomatoes and tomato products has been associated with decreased cancer risks. One fat-soluble compound identified in tomatoes which may be responsible for this association is lycopene. There may, however, be other antioxidants present in tomato-based foods, and total antioxidant capacity may be another way to rate the health benefits of these foods. In this work, we examined the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of aqueous and organic extracts of lycopene-containing foods: ketchup, fresh tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, tomato soup, tomato juice, vegetable juice, canned tomatoes and watermelon. Antioxidant activity in these food extracts was greater in the aqueous versus organic fractions, except for watermelon and tomato sauce where the levels were similar in the two fractions. Lycopene levels in the food samples tested, however, were relatively greater in the organic fractions, with the exception of the two juices, which had similar levels in the two fractions, and two highly concentrated tomato products, tomato paste and ketchup, which had relatively higher lycopene levels in the aqueous fractions. The foods with the highest antioxidant capacity per serving overall (tomato soup was highest) did not have the highest lycopene levels. This indicates that it may be important to consume a variety of tomato-containing products in order to obtain the largest variety of dietary antioxidants possible.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D000704', 'D000975', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D019662', 'D005519', 'D006801', 'D000077276', 'D018551', 'D014810']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Antioxidants', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucurbitaceae', 'Food Preservation', 'Humans', 'Lycopene', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Vitamin E']",Antioxidant capacity of lycopene-containing foods.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000031']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11303462,2001
