35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
34865786,"N,N-dimethylpiperidinium (mepiquat) is an important food contaminant formed from natural ingredients during thermal processing. In this study, mepiquat formation in meat (pork and beef) and vegetables (potatoes and broccoli) was investigated via HPLC-MS/MS; the investigated cooking methods were oven baking, pan cooking, deep frying, and microwaving. The results showed that, among all foods, oven-baked potatoes showed the highest mepiquat level of 1064 μg/kg, which appeared after 20 min at 240 °C. The residual rates of mepiquat precursors, pipecolic acid (PipAc), betaine, choline, and trigonelline, were determined in oven-baked potatoes to investigate their correlation with mepiquat formation. The PipAc levels reduced by 99.8% at 260 °C after 30 min of oven baking, exhibiting a significantly high decomposition rate. Therefore, PipAc could be used as a marker of quality for the detection of mepiquat in thermally processed foodstuffs.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000818', 'D002417', 'D006358', 'D008460', 'D010880', 'D053719', 'D000067075']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Hot Temperature', 'Meat', 'Piperidines', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetable Products']","Effects of thermal processing on N,N-dimethylpiperidinium (mepiquat) formation in meat and vegetable products.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34865786,2021

Due to the fact that pigmented corn flours contain biologically active and health-promoting phenolic and anthocyanin compounds, the objective of this study was to potentially define beneficial properties of flatbread by evaluating the acrylamide content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) with a detection limit of 1.8 µg/kg and proximate composition by standard methods of six experimental flatbreads made from two white, two blue, one red, and one yellow corn flours obtained by milling commercial seeds. Acrylamide content was also determined in experimental flatbreads made from combinations in quinoa flour, wheat flour, and peanut meal with added broccoli or beet vegetables and of commercial flatbreads including tortillas and wraps. Proximate analysis of flatbreads showed significant differences in protein and fat but not in carbohydrate, mineral, and water content. The acrylamide content of 16 evaluated flatbreads ranged from 0 to 49.1 µg/kg, suggesting that these flatbreads have the potential to serve as low-acrylamide functional foods.

34203867,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying and exploring the potential health benefits of foods, mainly from vegetables and fruits from regular intake. The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods' volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified. Each investigated fruit and vegetable showed a specific volatile metabolomic profile. The obtained results revealed that terpenic compounds, to which are associated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, are the most predominant chemical family in beetroot (61%), orange carrot (58%) and white carrot (61%), while organosulfur compounds (antiviral activity) are dominant in onion, garlic and watercress.

32036908,"Broccolini is originated from crossing the regular broccoli with Chinese kale. Consequently, it has similar properties to these vegetables, but other very particular characteristics. Its consumption has increased in the last few years and, consequently, there have been some studies related to its quality parameters and the influence of different cooking methods. Nevertheless, changes on its phenolic composition and mineral content originated by its cooking have not been investigated in-depth so far. Here we report the phytochemical profile of broccolini before and after boiling, steaming, and griddling cooking treatments. The mineral content and phytochemicals were assessed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), respectively. The main phenolics (mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives from caffeic, coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids) were quantified. Three oxylipins, three flavonoid glycosides and the glucosinolate glucobrassicin were also identified. ABTS and DPPH assays were also used as screening methods to assess the antioxidant potential of broccolini. A significant loss of the phenolic compounds and a reduction of the antioxidant activity were observed after the three cooking methods. Clear disadvantages were detected when broccolini was boiled, namely high losses of phenolic acids and derivatives (70%). Steaming and griddling also led to a significant loss of phenolics (50%) from fresh broccolini.

We focused our research to determine the amount of free cysteine consumed highly in foods such as pork, beef, poultry, eggs, dairy, red peppers, soybeans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, oats, and wheat germs. A newly designed carbazole-pyridine-based fluorescent probe (CPI) has been introduced for quantitative estimation of cysteine (Cys) with a ""turn on"" fluorescence in some popular processed food samples chosen from our daily diet.

NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study enlightens the formation of more stable product CPI-Cys.

30637439,"The Nrf2 signaling pathway is highly significant for redox homeostasis. Hence, nutrients and drugs activating Nrf2 can prevent oxidative stress-mediated medical conditions. After activation, Nrf2 accumulates in the cell nucleus; therefore, stimulation of Nrf2 by food components and drugs is usually monitored by measuring nuclear Nrf2 levels. The present study developed a targeted mass spectrometry method for the highly reliable quantification of nuclear Nrf2 levels. Three Nrf2-specific peptides were detected after enzymatic digestion of the nuclear fraction by the developed protocol for micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode (microLC-MS/MS-sMRM). The method also identified nuclear Nrf2 unequivocally and specifically in the SDS-PAGE fraction of 100-150 kDa. Moreover, highly precise and linear relative quantification was achieved (mean relative standard deviation 8.3%; coefficient of determination 0.998).

Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods. On average, CVs increased up to 4% and bias 8-12% when using 1-2 g test portions vs. 10-15 g.

The total phenolic contents, the scavenging activities against DPPH, oxygen, hydroxyl and ABTS cation radicals, and cell-based antioxidant activities were determined for the antioxidant capacities. The results indicated that chopping released the least nutraceutical components and antioxidant compounds. Microwaving had no effect on the I3C release from kale, but resulted in an elevated (more than 2-fold) release of I3C from broccoli. In addition, the choice of a blender affected the availability of the anti-proliferative compounds from the vegetables, while it had no effect on the availability of their anti-inflammatory compounds.

Glucosinolates were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and isothiocyanates were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection. A formation of isothiocyanates was observed in all high-pressure-treated sprouts. The highest degree of conversion (85%) was observed after the 600 MPa treatment. Increased isothiocyanate formation at 400-600 MPa suggests an inactivation of the epithiospecifier protein. During storage, color changed from green to brownish, reflected by increasing a* values and decreasing L* values.

A total of 144 samples (of black currants, red currants, raspberries, cherries, strawberries, blackberries, cauliflowers and broccoli) were analyzed using LC-MS/MS method for the determination of 60 pesticides. QuEChERS extraction, matrix-matched calibration and dynamic multiple reaction monitoring method were used. Residues of 15 compounds, mainly fungicides and insecticides, were detected in 46 samples. The percentage of samples with residues above the maximum residue levels (MRL) was 15%, whereas samples with residues below MRL were 17%. A total of 13 samples contained more than one pesticide residue. Pesticide residues were detected most often in samples of black currants (50%), broccoli (36.4%), raspberries (29%) and red currants (21.8%). The most frequently detected pesticides were carbendazim and acetamiprid. The proportion of pesticides detected during our study to the total number of analyzed pesticides amounted to 25%. It was compared to literature findings. For three fourth of multiresidue methods, the proportion was below 50% for methods developed for the analysis of less than 100 pesticides, and below 30% for methods developed for the analysis of more than 100 pesticides. It appears that a lot of efforts and means is lost on pesticides never or rarely detected in examined samples. The workload and cost effectiveness of the development and application of multiresidue methods along with the range of pesticides covered by the method should be carefully and thoroughly considered anytime when a new method or workflow is developed.

Previous work has shown that these permeates contribute to salty taste without contributing significantly to sodium content. The objective of this study was to explore the sensory characteristics and compositional analysis of permeates from different milk and whey streams and a low-sodium product application made from them. Skim milk, Cheddar, cottage, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were manufactured in triplicate, and delactosed whey permeate was obtained in triplicate. Composition (protein, fat, solids, minerals) was conducted on permeates. Organic acid composition was determined using HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from permeates by solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A trained sensory panel documented sensory attributes of permeates and cream of broccoli soups with and without salt or permeates followed by consumer acceptance testing (n=105) on the soups. Cottage cheese whey permeate contained a higher lactic acid content than other permeates, which has been shown to contribute to a higher salty taste. Cottage cheese whey permeate also contained potato or brothy and caramel flavors and sour and salty tastes, whereas delactosed whey permeate had high intensities of cardboard and beefy or brothy flavors and salty taste. Milk, Cheddar, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were characterized by sweet taste and cooked milky flavor. Permeates with higher cardboard flavor had higher levels of aldehydes. All permeates contributed to salty taste and to salty taste perception in soups; although the control soup with added salt was perceived as saltier and was preferred by consumers over permeate soups. Soup with permeate from cottage cheese was the least liked of all soups, likely due to its sour taste. All other permeate soups scored at parity for liking.

Since pyrethroid degradates can be identical to the urinary markers used in human biomonitoring, it is important to understand the contribution of these degradates when studying sources of human pyrethroid exposure. We modified the widely used Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method to measure several current-use pyrethroids (cis/trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin) and their environmental degradation products (3-PBA, cis/trans-DCCA, 4-F-3-PBA, DBCA, and MPA) in selected fresh fruits and vegetables. Using fortified samples, we determined extraction efficiencies from: tomatoes, oranges (whole, peeled, and rind), grapes, apples, bananas (peeled and rind only), onions, lettuce, green peppers, carrots and broccoli. For a subset of these food items (apples, grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peel), we also established limits of detection (MDLs) and quantitation (MQLs). Each sample was homogenized (1kg) then spiked with the target pyrethroids and their degradation products. Sub-samples (15g) were extracted with acetonitrile, then salted out and partitioned with NaCl and MgSO4. The extract was divided and further cleaned using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges containing either graphitized non-porous carbon (pyrethroids) or C18 (degradation products).

Standard AOAC methods were applied for nutritional value evaluation, while chromatographic methods with UV-VIS and FID detection were used to determine the free amino acids and fatty acids, respectively. Mineral content was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Sprouts composition revealed them as an excellent source of protein and dietary fiber.

Generally, bread supplementation elevated antioxidant potential of product (both nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant capacities); however, the increase was not correlated with the percent of BS. A replacement up to 2% of BS gives satisfactory overall consumers acceptability and desirable elevation of antioxidant potential. High activity was especially found for extracts obtained after simulated digestion, which allows assuming their protective effect for upper gastrointestinal tract; thus, the anticancer activity against human stomach cancer cells (AGS) was evaluated. A prominent cytostatic response paralleled by the inhibition of AGS motility in the presence of potentially mastication-extractable phytochemicals indicates that phenolic compounds of BS retain their biological activity in bread. Importantly, the efficient phenolics concentration was about 12 μM for buffer extract, 13 μM for extracts after digestion in vitro, and 7 μM for extract after absorption in vitro.

24845356,"U.S. food imports have been increasing steadily for decades, intensifying the need for a rapid and sensitive screening technique. A method has been developed that uses foam disks to sample the surface of incoming produce. This work provides complimentary information to the extensive amount of published pesticide fragmentation data collected using LCMS systems (Sack et al. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 59, 6383-6411, 2011; Mol et al. Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 403, 2891-2908, 2012). The disks are directly analyzed using transmission-mode direct analysis in real time (DART) ambient pressure desorption ionization coupled to a high resolution accurate mass-mass spectrometer (HRAM-MS). In order to provide more certainty in the identification of the pesticides detected, a library of accurate mass fragments and isotopes of the protonated parent molecular ion (the [M+H]⁺) has been developed. The HRAM-MS is equipped with a quadrupole mass filter, providing the capability of ""data-dependent"" fragmentation, as opposed to ""all -ion"" fragmentation (where all of the ions enter a collision chamber and are fragmented at once). A temperature gradient for the DART helium stream and multiple collision energies were employed to detect and fragment 164 pesticides of varying chemical classes, sizes, and polarities. The accurate mass information of precursor ([M+H]⁺ ion) and fragment ions is essential in correctly identifying chemical contaminants on the surface of imported produce. Additionally, the inclusion of isotopes of the [M+H]⁺ in the database adds another metric to the confirmation process. The fragmentation data were collected using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer and were added to a database used to process data collected with an Exactive mass spectrometer, an instrument that is more readily available for this screening application. The commodities investigated range from smooth-skinned produce such as apples to rougher surfaces like broccoli.

The process involves two simple steps. First, the homogenized samples are extracted and partitioned using an organic solvent and salt solution. Then, the supernatant is further extracted and cleaned using a dSPE technique. Final clear extracts of vegetables were concentrated under vacuum to near dryness and taken up into initial mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 20% methanol). The separation and quantification of free low molecular weight polyphenols from the vegetable extracts was achieved by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with a phodiode array (PDA) detection system and a Trifunctional High Strength Silica capillary analytical column (HSS T3), specially designed for polar compounds. The performance of the method was assessed by studying the selectivity, linear dynamic range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, trueness, and matrix effects. The validation parameters of the method showed satisfactory figures of merit. Good linearity (Rvalues2>0.954; (+)-catechin in carrot samples) was achieved at the studied concentration range.

Moreover, a breakdown product, 1-MIM alcohol, is metabolized to a secondary reactive intermediate by some mammalian sulfotransferases (SULTs). First, we incubated herring-sperm DNA with 1-MIM glucosinolate in the presence of myrosinase. We identified and synthesized the predominant adducts, N(2)-(1-MIM)-dG and N(6)-(1-MIM)-dA, and developed an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for their specific detection using isotopic dilution. Second, we demonstrated both DNA adducts in target cells (Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and Chinese hamster V79) of standard mutagenicity tests treated with 1-MIM glucosinolate/myrosinase as well as in 1-MIM alcohol-treated Salmonella and V79 cells engineered for expression of human SULT1A1. Similar excesses of N(2)-(1-MIM)-dG over N(6)-(1-MIM)-dA adducts were found in all cellular models independent of the test compound (1-MIM glucosinolate or alcohol), whereas dA adducts predominated in the cell-free system. Finally, we detected both DNA adducts in colon tissue of a mouse orally treated with 1-MIM glucosinolate.

A protocol for the collection of liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadruple linear ion trap (Q-LIT) mass spectrometry (MS) library spectra was developed. Following the protocol, an enhanced product ion (EPI) library of 240 pesticides was developed by use of spectra collected from two laboratories. A LC-Q-LIT-MS workflow using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) survey scan, information-dependent acquisition (IDA) triggered collection of EPI spectra, and library search was developed and tested to identify the 240 target pesticides in one single LC-Q-LIT MS analysis. By use of LC retention time, one sMRM survey scan transition, and a library search, 75-87% of the 240 pesticides were identified in a single LC/MS analysis at fortified concentrations of 10 ng/g in 18 different foods. A conventional approach with LC-MS/MS using two MRM transitions produced the same identifications and comparable quantitative results with the same incurred foods as the LC-Q-LIT using EPI library search, finding 1.2-49 ng/g of either carbaryl, carbendazim, fenbuconazole, propiconazole, or pyridaben in peaches; carbendazim, imazalil, terbutryn, and thiabendazole in oranges; terbutryn in salmon; and azoxystrobin in ginseng.

22351183,"The identification of metabolites in biochemical studies is a major bottleneck in the proliferating field of metabolomics. In particular in plant metabolomics, given the diversity and abundance of endogenous secondary metabolites in plants, the identification of these is not only challenging but also essential to understanding their biological role in the plant, and their value to quality and nutritional attributes as food crops. With the new generation of analytical technologies, in which liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) play a pioneering role, profiling metabolites in complex extracts is feasible at high throughput. However, the identification of key metabolites remains a limitation given the analytical effort necessary for traditional structural elucidation strategies. The hyphenation of LC-solid phase extraction (SPE)-NMR is a powerful analytical platform for isolating and concentrating metabolites for unequivocal identification by NMR measurements. The combination with LC-MS is a relatively straightforward approach to obtaining all necessary information for structural elucidation. Using this set-up, we could, as an example, readily identify five related glycosylated phenolic acids present in broccoli (Brassica oleracea, group Italica, cv Monaco): 1,2-di-O-E-sinapoyl-β-gentiobiose, 1-O-E-sinapoyl-2-O-E-feruloyl-β-gentiobiose, 1,2-di-O-E-feruloyl-β-gentiobiose, 1,2,2'-tri-O-E-sinapoyl-β-gentiobiose, and 1,2'-di-O-E-sinapoyl-2-O-E-feruloyl-β-gentiobiose.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D001937', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D055442', 'D055432', 'D052616']","['Brassica', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics', 'Solid Phase Extraction']",Chemical identification strategies using liquid chromatography-photodiode array-solid-phase extraction-nuclear magnetic resonance/mass spectrometry.,"['Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', None, None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351183,2012
22351174,"The Brassicaceae family comprises a variety of plant species that are of high economic importance as -vegetables or industrial crops. This includes crops such as Brassica rapa (turnip, Bok Choi), B. oleracea (cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), and B. napus (oil seed rape), and also includes the famous genetic model of plant research, Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress). Brassicaceae plants contain a large variety of interesting secondary metabolites, including glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids. These metabolites are also of particular importance due to their proposed positive effects on human health. Next to these well-known groups of phytochemicals, many more metabolites are of course also present in crude extracts prepared from Brassica and Arabidopsis plant material.High-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), especially if combined with a high mass resolution instrument such as a QTOF MS, is a powerful approach to separate, detect, and annotate metabolites present in crude aqueous-alcohol plant extracts. Using an essentially unbiased procedure that takes into account all metabolite mass signals from the raw data files, detailed information on the relative abundance of hundreds of both known and, as yet, unknown semipolar metabolites can be obtained. These comprehensive metabolomics data can then be used to, for instance, identify genetic markers regulating metabolic composition, determine effects of (a)biotic stress or specific growth conditions, or establish metabolite changes occurring upon food processing or storage.This chapter describes in detail a procedure for preparing crude extracts and performing comprehensive HPLC-QTOF MS-based profiling of semi-polar metabolites in Brassicaceae plant material.

To identify novel genes whose products are involved in Se volatilization from plants, a broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica) cDNA encoding COQ5 methyltransferase (BoCOQ5-2) in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway was isolated. Its function was authenticated by complementing a yeast coq5 mutant and by detecting increased cellular ubiquinone levels in the BoCOQ5-2-transformed bacteria. BoCOQ5-2 was found to promote Se volatilization in both bacteria and transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Bacteria expressing BoCOQ5-2 produced an over 160-fold increase in volatile Se compounds when they were exposed to selenate. Consequently, the BoCOQ5-2-transformed bacteria had dramatically enhanced tolerance to selenate and a reduced level of Se accumulation. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing BoCOQ5-2 volatilized three times more Se than the vector-only control plants when treated with selenite and exhibited an increased tolerance to Se. In addition, the BoCOQ5-2 transgenic plants suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species induced by selenite. BoCOQ5-2 represents, to our knowledge, the first plant enzyme that is not known to be directly involved in sulfur/Se metabolism yet was found to mediate Se volatilization. This discovery opens up new prospects regarding our understanding of the complete metabolism of Se and may lead to ways to modify Se-accumulator plants with increased efficiency for phytoremediation of Se-contaminated environments.",Plant physiology,"['D000222', 'D000595', 'D017360', 'D001419', 'D001937', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D008401', 'D020869', 'D018506', 'D005816', 'D023281', 'D008780', 'D008969', 'D009154', 'D030821', 'D021381', 'D012441', 'D012643', 'D018036', 'D013347', 'D014835']","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Bacteria', 'Brassica', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genomics', 'Methyltransferases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Protein Transport', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Selenium', 'Selenium Compounds', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Volatilization']",Involvement of a broccoli COQ5 methyltransferase in the production of volatile selenium compounds.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None]","[None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'enzymology', None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656903,2009

Sulfites were extracted with sodium tetrachloromercurate solution and determined by HPLC-fluorescence spectrometry. During the HPLC analysis, the sample extract was reacted with sodium hydroxide to liberate the reversibly-bound sulfite and subsequently separated from other interferences by a size exclusion column. The effluent was then reacted with o-phthalaldehydelammonium chloride reagent to form a fluorescing 1-sulfonatoisoindole derivative and analyzed by a fluorescence detector. The method has been applied to a variety of foods and food products, with no significant interference encountered in matrixes such as soy products, cabbage, broccoli, brassica, ginger, fungus, mushroom, mandarin peel, potato chips, and biscuits.

Bioavailability is a critical feature in the assessment of the role of micronutrients in human health, and the approaches to this issue include in vitro and in vivo methods. Our aim was to evaluate the bioavailability of carotenoids and tocopherols present in broccoli and to compare in vitro and in vivo approaches. Fourteen apparently healthy volunteers consumed 200 g broccoli once a day for seven days. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after intervention to determine changes in lutein, beta-carotene, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol as relevant phytochemicals provided with this vegetable. Broccoli also was subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to assess changes related to preabsorptive processes. Analytes in serum and at each phase of the digestion were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. During the intervention, the amounts supplied daily ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 mg lutein, 1.4 to 1.8 mg beta-carotene, 4.5 to 6.8 mg alpha-tocopherol, and 0.8 to 1.8 mg gamma-tocopherol. Significant changes in serum in both men and women were observed only for lutein, whereas for gamma-tocopherol a significant change was detected in women. No changes were observed for alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, the alpha-tocopherol-to-cholesterol ratio, or serum lipids. Using the in vitro model, more than 75% of lutein, beta-carotene, gamma-tocopherol, and alpha-tocopherol remained at the duodenal phase, whereas incorporation into the supernatants accounted for <20% of the initial content in food. Regular consumption of broccoli at dietary levels increased serum concentrations of lutein and gamma-tocopherol without affecting alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene status in serum.

A combined isocratic and linear gradient allowed separation of vitamins in 3 distinct groups: polar, low-polar, and nonpolar. The method was applied to pharmaceutical preparations, fortified powdered drinks, and food samples, for which results were in good agreement with values claimed. Heudi et al. described a separation of 9 water-soluble vitamins by LC-UV. The method was applied for the quantification of vitamins in polyvitaminated premixes used for the fortification of infant nutrition products. The repeatability of the method was evaluated at different concentration levels and coefficients of variation were <6.5%. The concentrations of vitamins found in premixes with the method were comparable to the values declared. A disadvantage of the methods mentioned above is that sample composition has to be known in advance. According to European legislation, for example, foods might be fortified with riboflavin phosphate or thiamin phosphate, vitamers which are not included in the simultaneous separations described. Vitamin B2.--Viñas et al. elaborated an LC analysis of riboflavin vitamers in foods.

Several methods usually involve the conversion of these coenzymes into free riboflavin before quantification of total riboflavin. According to the authors, there is growing interest to know flavin composition of foods. The described method separates the individual vitamers isocratically. Accuracy of the method is tested with 2 certified reference materials (CRMs). Vitamin B5.-Methods for the determination of vitamin B5 in foods are limited because of their low sensitivity and poor selectivity. Pakin et al. proposed a post-column derivatization of pantothenic acid as a fluorescent compound and used this principle in a specific and sensitive method for the determination of free and bound pantothenic acid in a large variety of foods. A French laboratory invited European laboratories to participate in a series of collaborative studies for this method, which will be carried out in 2005/2006. A more sophisticated method was described by Mittermayer et al. They developed an LC-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for the determination of vitamin B5 in a wide range of fortified food products. Application of the method to various samples showed consistent results with those obtained by microbiology. Vitamin B6.-Method 2004.07, an LC method for the analysis of vitamin B6 in reconstituted infant formula, was published by Mann et al. In contrast with this method, which quantifies vitamin B6 after converting the phosphorylated and free vitamers into pyridoxine, Viñas et al. published an LC method which determines 6 vitamin B6 related compounds, the 3 B6 vitamers, their corresponding phosphorylated esters, and a metabolite. Accuracy was determined using 2 CRMs. Results were within the certified ranges. Vitamin C.-Franke et al. described an extensive study to vitamin C and flavonoid levels of fruits and vegetables consumed in Hawaii. Vitamin C was determined by measuring ascorbic acid in its reduced state by LC and coulometric detection along with UV absorbance detection at 245 nm. No attempts were made to assess levels of dehydroascorbic acid. Most recent research revealed that cell uptake of dehydroascorbic acid is unlikely to play a major role, which may explain the very low vitamin C activity of orally administered L-dehydroascorbic acid in rats. The food levels found by Franke et al. are variably lower, higher, or equal in comparison to other studies. Iwase described a method for the determination of ascorbic acid in foods using L-methionine for the pre-analysis sample stabilization. Electrochemical detection was used for the quantification. Traditionally, metaphosphoric acid was proven to be a useful dissolving agent for the determination of ascorbic acid. However, it dissolves in water very slowly, it is hygroscopic, and accurate weighing is not easy. Adjustment at pH 2-3 takes a long time. It appeared to be possible to replace metaphosphoric acid by 0.2% phosphoric acid. Methionine played an important role on the stability of ascorbic acid. The method seemed to be applicable to the routine analysis of ascorbic acid in foods. Folic Acid.-Microbiological analysis of total folate in foods is often considered as the golden standard compared to other methods based on, for example, LC. Koontz et al. showed results of total folate concentrations measured by microbiological assay in a variety of foods. Samples were submitted in a routine manner to experienced laboratories that regularly perform folate analysis fee-for-service basis in the United States. Each laboratory reported the use of a microbiological method similar to the AOAC Official Method for the determination of folic acid. Striking was, the use of 3 different pH extraction conditions by 4 laboratories. Only one laboratory reported using a tri-enzyme extraction. Results were evaluated. Results for folic acid fortified foods had considerably lower between-laboratory variation, 9-11%, versus >45% for other foods. Mean total folate ranged from 14 to 279 microg/100 g for a mixed vegetable reference material, from 5 to 70 microg/100 g for strawberries, and from 28 to 81 microg/100 g for wholemeal flour. One should realize a large variation in results, which might be caused by slight modifications in the microbiological analysis of total folate in foods or the analysis in various (unfortified) food matrixes. Furthermore, optimal combination of enzymes and reaction conditions may vary depending on the composition of the food. Padrangi and Laborde showed recently that treatment with alpha-amylase had no significant effect on measured folate in spinach, although addition of protease significantly increased the release of folate. LC/MS applications gain increasing attention because of their specificity. Rychlik used stable isotope dilution assays for the determination of the folate content of broccoli and bread. Compared to data in the literature and food data bases, amounts were significantly lower. Pawlosky et al., however, found comparable values for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folic acid by HPLC analysis with fluorescent detection and HPLC/MS. Among samples analyzed were CRMs and broccoli. Besides folic acid, other water-soluble vitamins were also determined by LC/MS/MS by Leporati et al. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of the natural content of vitamins in typical Italian pasta samples, as well as in fortified pasta samples produced for the U.S. market. Biotin.-A paper from Staggs et al. included the assertion that existing biotin data in food composition tables are inaccurate because the majority are based on bioassays with all relevant disadvantages. Data in most cases are overestimated with consequences for recommendations for dietary biotin intake. An HPLC/avidin-binding assay was used to analyze 87 foods to support the hypothesis mentioned.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002623', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005527', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D020349', 'D025101', 'D014815', 'D014867']","['Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food, Fortified', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Vitamin B 6', 'Vitamins', 'Water']",Water-soluble vitamins.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512258,2006
16399004,"Changes in isoperoxidases involved in chlorophyll (Chl) degradation of stored broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) florets and their control by heat treatment (HT) were determined. Chl a and b contents in non-heat-treated broccoli florets decreased greatly after 2 days at 15 degrees C, whereas the contents in heat-treated florets (50 degrees C for 2 h) showed almost no change. Three isoperoxidases involved in Chl degradation were detected by means of molecular exclusion chromatography and the molecular weights of those isoperoxidases were about 95 (Type I), 67 (Type II) and 56 (Type III) kDa, respectively. Only Type I was detected in broccoli florets immediately after harvest, and its activity in non-heat-treated broccoli increased greatly during storage. Both Type II and Type III were present in non-heat-treated broccoli with floret senescence. HT suppressed the enhancement of all of the isoperoxidase activities. Cycloheximide treatment also effectively retarded the increase in Types I, II and III isoperoxidase activities concomitant with the suppression of floret yellowing. The K(m) values corresponding to Chl a of Type II and Type III were lower than Type I, and the V(max)/K(m) values corresponding to Chl a of Type II and Type III were higher than Type I.

16117613,"Broccoli is a food often consumed for its potential health-promoting properties. The health benefits of broccoli are partly associated with secondary plant compounds that have bioactivity; glucosinolates and phenolic acids are two of the most abundant and important in broccoli. In an effort to determine how variety, stress, and production conditions affect the production of these bioactive components broccoli was grown in the greenhouse with and without selenium (Se) fertilization, and in the field under conventional or organic farming procedures and with or without water stress. High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to separate and identify 12 primary phenolic compounds. Variety had a major effect: There was a preponderance of flavonoids in the Majestic variety, but hydroxycinnamic esters were relatively more abundant in the Legacy variety. Organic farming and water stress decreased the overall production of phenolics. Se fertilization increased glucosinolates in general, and sulforaphane in particular, up to a point; above that Se fertilization decreased glucosinolate production. Organic farming and water stress also decreased glucosinolate production. These data show environmental and genetic variation in phenolics and glucosinolates in broccoli, and warn that not all broccoli may contain all health-promoting bioactive components.

The analytical performance of the method was evaluated for different types of fruit and vegetables: pepper, broccoli, tomato, orange, lemon, apple and melon. The accurate mass measurements were compared in different matrices at significantly different concentration levels (from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg) obtaining accuracy errors lower than 2 ppm, which is well within the accepted limits for elemental confirmation. Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression or enhancement of the response were frequently observed, most notably in broccoli and citrus. Instrumental limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.0005 and 0.03 mg/kg depending on the commodity and pesticide studied, all being within European Union regulations for food monitoring program. Finally, the methodology was applied to the analysis of two samples from an inter-laboratory exercise.

15073045,"Consumption of red meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, whereas cruciferous vegetable consumption reduces cancer risk. While the mechanisms remain to be determined, cruciferous vegetables may act by altering the metabolism of carcinogens present in cooked food, such as the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cruciferous vegetable consumption on the metabolism of PhIP in 20 non-smoking Caucasian male subjects. The study consisted of three 12-day phases, namely two periods of avoidance of cruciferous vegetables (phases 1 and 3) and a high cruciferous vegetable diet period (phase 2), when subjects ingested 250 g each of Brussels sprouts and broccoli per day. At the end of each study phase, the subjects consumed a cooked meat meal containing 4.90 microg PhIP and urine samples were collected for up to 48 h. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased hepatic CYP1A2, as demonstrated by changes in saliva caffeine kinetics. Samples of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(2)-glucuronide (the major urinary metabolite of PhIP in humans), N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide and their trideuterated derivatives (to serve as internal standards) were synthesized and a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry method developed for their analysis. In phases 1 and 3, the excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-N(2)-PhIP-glucuronide in 0-48 h urine samples was six times that of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(2)-glucuronide in 0-48 h urine samples to 127 and 136% of levels observed in phases 1 and 3, respectively. In contrast, the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide was unchanged. While the urinary excretion of both PhIP metabolites accounted for approximately 39% of the PhIP dose in phases 1 and 3, they accounted for approximately 49% of the dose in phase 2.

Sequence analysis predicted apoplastic secretion signals for all database entries similar to the partial xylem protein sequences. This and the lack of cross-reactivity with phloem protein-specific antibodies suggest that the proteins really originate from the xylem and do not result from phloem contamination. Most of the highly similar proteins probably function in repair and defence reactions.

Storage in OPP (14% O(2), 10.5% CO(2)) resulted in most of the off-odors, while storage in LDPE (6% O(2), 7% CO(2)) and PVC (17.9% O(2), 4% CO(2)) was found to maintain the concentration of DMS, DMDS, and DMTS during storage.

Both compounds as components of an onion and broccoli extract could readily permeate the enterocytes in the perfused jejunal segment. At the physiologically relevant, dietary concentration tested, the average effective jejunal permeability (Peff) and percentage absorbed (+/- S.D.) were 18.7 +/- 12.6 x 10-4 cm/s and 74 +/- 29% for sulforaphane and 8.9 +/- 7.1 x 10-4 cm/s and 60 +/- 31% for quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, respectively. Furthermore, a proportion of each compound was conjugated and excreted back into the lumen as sulforaphane-glutathione and quercetin-3'-glucuronide. The capacity of the isolated segment to deconjugate quercetin from quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside during the perfusion was much higher than the beta-glucosidase activity of the preperfusion jejunal contents, indicating that the majority (79-100%) of the beta-glucosidase capacity derives from the enterocytes in situ. Simultaneously, we determined short-term changes in gene expression in exfoliated enterocytes, which showed 2.0 +/- 0.4-fold induction of glutathione transferase A1 (GSTA1) mRNA (p < 0.002) and 2.4 +/- 1.2-fold induction of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) mRNA (p < 0.02). The changes in gene expression were also seen in differentiated Caco-2 cells, where sulforaphane was responsible for induction of GSTA1 and quercetin for induction of UGT1A1.

The results showed a complete inhibition of S. aureus in the broccoli soup by the essential oils of 'Sweet Mimosa', 'Mabel Grey', P. graveolens, 'Atomic Snowflake', 'Royal Oak', 'Attar of Roses' and a lesser effect by 'Chocolate Peppermint' and 'Clorinda'; the hydrosols, however, had a potentiating effect on the bacterial population in the food. Both extracts showed a complete inhibition of S. aureus in the Maximum Recovery Diluent (MRD). Antibacterial activity against E. aerogenes in the broccoli soup was generally very much reduced: only the essential oil of 'Mabel Grey' showed complete inhibition and virtually no reductions in colonies were seen with the other essential oils; the hydrosols again caused an increase in bacterial colonies. All the essential oils, bar Chocolate Peppermint showed complete inhibition of E. aerogenes in MRD, but the hydrosols showed no effect. The results strongly suggest that the residual hydrosols from distillation of these plant essential oils have no potential as antibacterial agents in foods, in contrast to most of the essential oils, which show potential against some micro-organisms, but only in some food systems.

The results showed that at 20 degrees C, 55% loss of glucoraphanin concentration occurred in broccoli stored in open boxes during the first 3 days of the treatment and 56% loss was found in broccoli stored in plastic bags by day 7. Under both air and controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, glucoraphanin concentration appeared to fluctuate slightly during 25 days of storage and the concentrations under CA was significantly higher than those stored under air treatment. In modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) treatments, glucoraphanin concentration in air control packaging decreased significantly whereas there were no significant changes in glucoraphanin concentration in MAP with no holes at 4 degrees C and two microholes at 20 degrees C for up to 10 days. Decreases in glucoraphanin concentration occurred when the broccoli heads deteriorated. In the present study, the best method for preserving glucoraphanin concentration in broccoli heads after harvest was storage of broccoli in MAP and refrigeration at 4 degrees C.

Laboratory-cooked beef, pork, and chicken are capable of producing tens of nanograms of MeIQx, IFP, and PhIP per gram of meat and smaller amounts of other heteroyclic amines. Well-done restaurant-cooked beef, pork, and chicken may contain PhIP and IFP at concentrations as high as tens of nanograms per gram and MeIQx at levels up to 3 ng/g. Although well-done chicken breast prepared in the laboratory may contain large amounts of PhIP, a survey of flame-grilled meat samples cooked in private homes showed PhIP levels in beef steak and chicken breast are not significantly different (P=0.36). The extremely high PhIP levels reported in some studies of grilled chicken are not seen in home-cooked samples.Many studies suggest individuals may have varying susceptibility to carcinogens and that diet may influence metabolism, thus affecting cancer susceptibility. To understand the human metabolism of PhIP, we examined urinary metabolites of PhIP in volunteers following a single well-done meat exposure. Using solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS, we quantified four major PhIP metabolites in human urine. In addition to investigating individual variation, we examined the interaction of PhIP with a potentially chemopreventive food. In a preliminary study of the effect of broccoli on PhIP metabolism, we fed chicken to six volunteers before and after eating steamed broccoli daily for 3 days. Preliminary results suggest that broccoli, which contains isothiocyanates shown to induce Phases I and II metabolism in vitro, may affect both the rate of metabolite excretion and the metabolic products of a dietary carcinogen.

11048781,"Epidemologic studies have shown inverse correlation between the consumption of carotenoid-rich vegetables and the incidence of cancer. Therefore, analytical techniques for the quantitative determination of carotenoids in complex sample matrices are important. The most used method is reversed-phase (RP)-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this study, seventeen mobile-phase systems described in the literature and six RP-HPLC columns with differences in particle size and porosity are evaluated. Derived from these results, a new mobile-phase (acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and n-heptane) including solvent modifiers is presented, which allows an improved and more efficient separation of carotenoids. From all columns tested, the best chromatographic parameters are found using a silica C18 column (250 x 2 mm, 5 microm, 100 A). As was found, absorbance detection at 450 nm allows the determination of the carotenoids down to the picogram range with good linearity (R2 > 0.98). For the identification and quantitation of carotenoids in complex sample matrices (containing additionally other ultraviolet-absorbing compounds), the optimized RP chromatographic system is coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) using an atmospheric pressure ionization interface. The calibration plots show high linearity (R2 > 0.99), and the detection limit is found in the lower nanogram range. Furthermore, collision-induced dissociation in the ion source allows for the identification of carotenoids by their characteristic fragmentation pathways. In this study, a total of nine species of vegetables commonly consumed in Central Europe are analyzed for their contents of carotenoids (namely lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene) by RP-HPLC and RP-HPLC-MS-MS. It is found that good sources for lutein are spinach, kale, and broccoli, and sources for beta-carotene are broccoli, spinach, kale, carrots, and tomatoes.

All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

8568910,"Hydroquinone (HQ) is a nonvolatile chemical used in the photographic, rubber, chemical, and cosmetic industries. HQ is also known to occur in nature as the beta-D-glucopyranoside conjugate (arbutin), and free HQ is a known component of cigarette smoke. Low concentrations of HQ have been detected in the urine and plasma of humans with no occupational or other known exposure to HQ. The studies reported here investigate dietary and other potential sources of HQ and their contribution to HQ concentrations in the plasma and urine of human volunteers. Analysis of possible food sources of HQ by GC indicated significant amounts of arbutin in wheat products (1-10 ppm), pears (4-15 ppm), and coffee and tea (0.1 ppm). Free HQ was found in coffee (0.2 ppm), red wine (0.5 ppm), wheat cereals (0.2-0.4 ppm), and broccoli (0.1 ppm). After consuming a meal including arbutin- and HQ-containing foods, volunteers showed significant increases in plasma and urinary levels of HQ and its conjugated metabolites (total HQ). Mean plasma concentrations of total HQ peaked at 5 times background levels at 2 h after the completion of the meal, and mean urinary excretion rates of total HQ peaked at 12 times background at 2-3 h after the meal. Immediately after smoking four cigarettes in approximately 30 min, mean plasma concentrations of total HQ were maximally 1.5 times background levels; mean urinary excretion rates of total HQ peaked at 2.5 times background at 1-3 h after smoking.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil. The highest vegetable Pb values are for leek and onion (approximately 0.35 microgram/g). Background values are also provided for nineteen elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Br, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Se, Sr, V, and Zn). Exposure to motor vehicle activities at a site some 30 m from the M25 shows only significant increases in Pb for unwashed plant material and surface soils.

HPLC values were lower in four of the five highest vitamin C contributors to the US diet (orange juice, grapefruit, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes), as well as in broccoli, red peppers, and cooked collard and mustard greens, compared with values from the other databases. When HPLC values were substituted in the Health Habits and History Questionnaire, the resulting estimates of dietary intake of vitamin C in two studies were lower. Despite these lower estimates of absolute intake, in one study the correlation between dietary vitamin C and plasma ascorbic acid was similar.

Carbamates are separated on a reverse-phase liquid chromatography column, using a methanol-water gradient mobile phase. Separation is followed by postcolumn hydrolysis to yield methylamine, and the formation of a fluorophore with o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol prior to fluorescence detection. Recovery data were obtained by fortifying 5 different crops (apples, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, and potatoes) at 0.05 and 0.5 ppm.

6299911,"Groups of male Wistar rats were given either a basal diet or diets supplemented with 10 or 25% broccoli or 0.8% BHA. Liver fractions were assayed for cytochrome P-450, for aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), glutathione-S-transferase and epoxide hydrolase activities and for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) metabolism. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of liver microsomes was also performed. Mean relative liver weight in the BHA group was significantly higher than that of the control and 10% broccoli groups but not significantly higher than that of the 25% broccoli group. Gel electrophoresis of liver microsomes indicated a diet-dependent variation in intensity in a band that corresponded in mol wt to those of certain cytochrome P-450s. Diet-dependent increases (20-90% over control) in cytochrome P-450 and in the activities of AHH, glutathione-S-transferase and epoxide hydrolase were observed in livers from rats given broccoli-supplemented diets. Except for AHH activity, such increases also occurred in the group fed BHA. Analysis of BaP metabolites revealed that the proportion of 4,5-diol formed relative to the major diols identified was unchanged in the broccoli- or BHA-treated groups relative to the control group. The proportion of 9,10-diol formed was unchanged in the broccoli-fed groups but was significantly higher in the BHA group than in the control group. The proportion of cis and trans-7,8-diol formed was unchanged in both broccoli-fed groups but was significantly lower in the BHA group. In comparison with the control group, the ratio of phenol I (comprising primarily 9-OH-BaP) to total phenols (primarily 9-OH and 3-OH) was significantly decreased by about 30% in the 25%-broccoli group and by about 70% in the BHA group. Qualitative differences in the phenol-II peak (comprising 3-OH and 7-OH phenols) were also observed between samples from the controls and those of 25%-broccoli- and BHA-fed rats.
