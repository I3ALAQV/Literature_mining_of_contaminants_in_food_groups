34287657,"Zearalenone (ZEN), an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several species of Fusarium fungi, is a common contaminant of cereal-based food worldwide. Due to frequent occurrences associated with high levels of ZEN, maize oil is a particular source of exposure. Although a European maximum level for ZEN in maize oil exists according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2007 along with a newly developed international standard method for analysis, certified reference materials (CRM) are still not available. To overcome this lack, the first CRM for the determination of ZEN in contaminated maize germ oil (ERM®-BC715) was developed in the frame of a European Reference Materials (ERM®) project according to the requirements of ISO Guide 35. The whole process of CRM development including preparation, homogeneity and stability studies, and value assignment is presented. The assignment of the certified mass fraction was based upon an in-house study using high-performance liquid chromatography isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, to support the in-house certification study, an interlaboratory comparison study was conducted with 13 expert laboratories using different analytical methods.

33276511,"This paper reports data from a characterization study conducted on the unsaponifiable lipid fraction of dry-grind corn bioethanol side streams. Phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in different lots of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage collected from a bioethanol plant over a time-span of one year. Fat-soluble bioactives were present at high levels in corn oil, with a prevalence of plant sterols over tocols and squalene. Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol accounted altogether for more than 60% of total sterols. The carotenoid profile was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin as the prevalent molecules. The unsaponifiable lipid fraction profile of thin stillage was qualitatively similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil but, in quantitative terms, the amounts of valuable biomolecules were much lower because of the very high dilution of this side stream. Results indicate that post-fermentation corn oil is a promising and sustainable source of health-promoting bioactive molecules. The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of bioactive molecules with high antioxidant potentialities and their potential multifaceted market applications as functional ingredients for food, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical formulations, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new bio-based value chains and maximize the sustainability of corn dry-grind bioethanol biorefineries.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Corn Bioethanol Side Streams: A Potential Sustainable Source of Fat-Soluble Bioactive Molecules for High-Value Applications.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276511,2020

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with cannulated mesenteric lymph ducts and hepatic portal veins were given single doses of either 5 mg/kg DLM or 60 mg/kg CPM via the duodenum and lymph and portal blood samples collected for up to 300 min. The pyrethroid dosing vehicles (5 mL/kg body weight) were either corn oil or glycerol formal. Levels of DLM and CPM in lymph and portal blood samples were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. Over the time period studied, levels of both DLM and CPM following administration in either corn oil or glycerol formal were greater in lymph than in portal blood. Lymphatic uptake of both DLM and CPM was enhanced following dosing in glycerol formal than in corn oil. The results of this study suggest that after oral administration to rats, these two pyrethroids are predominantly absorbed via the lymphatic system rather than via portal blood.

Further, we explored various parameters of enzymatic detoxification in neutralized oil and analyzed tocopherols and sterols losses in the corn oil. In addition, the distribution of degraded products was demonstrated as well by Agilent 6510 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry.

Compared with the neutralized oil, no significant difference in the total tocopherols and sterols contents was detected after enzymatic detoxification.

31293441,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the leading cause of chronic liver injury and the third most common reason for liver transplantations in Western countries. It is unclear so far how different fat sources in Western diets (WD) influence the development of NASH. Our study investigates the impact of non-trans fat (NTF) and corn oil (Corn) as fat source in a WD mouse model of steatohepatitis on disease development and progression. C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice were fed ""standard"" WD (WD-Std), WD-NTF or WD-Corn for 24 weeks. WT animals treated with WD-NTF exhibit distinct features of the metabolic syndrome compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. This becomes evident by a worsened insulin resistance and elevated serum ALT, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to WD-Corn. Animals fed WD-Corn on the contrary tend to a weakened disease progression in the described parameters. After 24 weeks feeding with WD-NTF and WD-Std, WD-Corn lead to a comparable steatohepatitis initiation by histomorphological changes and immune cell infiltration compared to WD-Std. Immune cell infiltration results in a significant increase in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, which is more pronounced in WD-NTF compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. Interestingly the fat source has no impact on the composition of accumulating fat within liver tissue as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging of multiple lipid classes. The described effects of different fat sources on the development of steatohepatitis finally resulted in variations in fibrosis development. Animals treated with WD-NTF displayed massive collagen accumulation, whereas WD-Corn even seems to protect from extracellular matrix deposition. Noteworthy, WD-Corn provokes massive histomorphological modifications in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and severe accumulation of extracellular matrix which are not apparent in WD-Std and WD-NTF treatment. Different fat sources in WD-Std contribute to strong steatohepatitis development in WT mice after 24 weeks treatment. Surprisingly, corn oil provokes histomorphological changes in eWAT tissue. Accordingly, both WD-NTF and WD-Corn appear suitable as alternative dietary treatment to replace ""standard"" WD-Std as a diet mouse model of steatohepatitis whereas WD-Corn leads to strong changes in eWAT morphology.",Frontiers in physiology,[],[],The Influence of Different Fat Sources on Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis Development in the Western Diet Mouse Model of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293441,2020

These compounds are mostly composed of PYR isomers ranking top ten in acute lethality in rats. Concurrently, we administered near-threshold levels of the four PYRs dissolved in corn oil by oral route. Six hours later blood was collected and the liver and cerebellum were dissected out to determine PYR concentrations in these tissues using Gas Chromatography with Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). The mixture caused mild-to-moderate changes in non-locomotor behaviors and subcutaneous body temperature (up to +1.2-1.5 °C increase at 2-4 h after dosing, respectively, compared to pre-dosing records).

Because the high price of peony seed oil may tempt unscrupulous merchants to dilute it with cheaper substitutes, a rapid detection method for likely adulterants is required. In this study, the fatty acid composition of peony seed oil and four less expensive edible oils (soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil) were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Peony oil adulterated by other edible oils was assessed using iodine values to estimate the extent of adulteration. Adulteration was also measured using an electronic nose (E-nose) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results indicated that peony seed oil was highly enriched in α-linolenic acid. Although the iodine value can be used to detect some adulterants by measuring unsaturation, it was not able to detect all four potential adulterants. In contrast, the E-nose can rapidly identify adulterated peony seed oil by sampling vapor. Data analyses using PCA and LDA show that LDA more effectively clusters the data, discriminates between pure and adulterated oil, and can detect adulteration at the 10% level.

29641539,"The goal of this project was to increase the nutrient value of fillets, by-product muscle, and offal of aquacultured tilapia. A diet that includes seafood with a high omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid content, more specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are known to have numerous health benefits for consumers. Improved nutrient value of the offal may also attract new market opportunities for the aquaculture industry. Tilapia were cultured on different experimental feeds that contained various levels of n-3 fatty acids from either fish oil (FO) or algae meal (AM) that were used to replace corn oil. The experimental diets included a control (corn oil 6.3%), FO1%, FO3%, FO5%, AM1.75%, AM5.26%, and AM8.77%. All diets were formulated to be isocaloric, isonitrogenous, and isolipid. Three hundred and fifty tilapia with an initial mean weight of 158±2 g were cultured in a recirculating aquaculture system (seven diets replicated at the tank level, 14 tanks, 25 fish per tank). For all of the production performance data, no differences (P>0.05) were observed between the experimental groups which included survival (overall mean ± standard error, 99.4±0.3%), growth per week (45.4±1.0 g/wk), food conversion ratio (1.32±0.03), fillet yield (44.4±0.2%), hepatosomatic index (1.61±0.02), viscerosomatic index (2.86±0.06), and mesenteric fat index (0.97±0.04).

28784473,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are superfine cellulose fibrils with a nanoscale diameter and have gained increasing attention due to their great potential in the food industry. However, the applications of CNFs in active food packaging are still limited. The objectives of this study were to develop biopolymer-based edible nanocomposite films using CNFs, corn starch, and chitosan, and to investigate the effect and mechanisms of CNFs on the active functions and properties of the nanocomposite films. Important functional properties of the films were measured and the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Zetasizer. The results demonstrate that CNFs increased the rigidity of the films due to more hydrogen bonds being induced by CNFs (≥60%). Incorporating a high content of CNFs (≥60%) in the film resulted in enhanced filling effect on the structure of the biopolymer films, which significantly improved the light barrier, oxygen barrier and water vapor barrier capacities. As CNF content increased to 100%, the film opacity increased by 59%, while the peroxide value of corn oil protected with edible films was reduced by 23%. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of the edible films with 80% and 100% CNFs were increased by up to 2logCFU/g on day 8 in a beef model, due to more positive charges in the films and improved blocking effects on oxygen. These results demonstrate that CNFs can effectively enhance the antimicrobial effect and barrier properties of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films and have great potential in applications of active packaging for food products.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002482', 'D048271', 'D005516', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D006860', 'D008855', 'D053761', 'D057139', 'D036103', 'D010100', 'D010539', 'D018583', 'D000069466', 'D013056', 'D017550', 'D013213', 'D013499', 'D014867']","['Cellulose', 'Chitosan', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Nanocomposites', 'Nanofibers', 'Nanotechnology', 'Oxygen', 'Permeability', 'Pliability', 'Red Meat', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Starch', 'Surface Properties', 'Water']",Effect and mechanism of cellulose nanofibrils on the active functions of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784473,2019

To address the potential health risk from co-exposure to pyrethroids, it is important to understand their disposition and toxicity in target organs such as the brain, and surrogates such as the blood when administered as a mixture. The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between blood and brain concentrations of pyrethroids and neurobehavioral effects in the rat following an acute oral administration of the pyrethroids as a mixture.

The method used dispersive SPE (d-SPE) to clean the samples, and GC negative chemical ion MS (GC-NCI-MS) to analyze the samples. High-quality trace analysis of pyrethroids in biological samples was necessary to assess the health risk of environmentally encountered levels. Currently used highly sensitive methods to measure pyrethroids have focused on large-volume samples related to environmental exposure (water, soil, food products) or urine; however, there are no validated methods for quantifying this class of compounds in small-volume rat liver and muscle tissue homogenates. Individual rat tissue homogenate samples (300 μL) were prepared by protein precipitation using hexane-saturated acetonitrile. The samples were mixed on a vortex mixer and decanted into a d-SPE tube containing octadecylsilyl (C18) and primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbents and magnesium sulfate. The samples were centrifuged before evaporation to dryness. Pyrethroids were extracted and reconstituted from the residue using toluene in advance of injection into an Agilent Model 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a Model 5973 quadrupole mass analyzer. Samples were ionized via electron capture in the negative ion mode using methane as a chemical ionization gas.

26408834,"Antioxidant properties of the aqueous extracts of hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) that had been roasted at 210 °C for 20 min were determined in bulk oil and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Bulk oils were heated at 60, 100, and 180 °C, and O/W emulsions were oxidized under riboflavin photosensitization. The content of phenolic compounds was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and in vitro antioxidant assays were also conducted. The major phenolics contained in the aqueous extract of roasted hulled barley (AERB) were p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, and vanillic acids. Depending on the concentration and oxidation temperature, AERB had antioxidant or prooxidant properties in bulk oil. At 60 °C, AERB at a concentration of 0.5% acted as a prooxidant, whereas at 1.0% it acted as an antioxidant. At 100 °C, AERB acted as an antioxidant irrespective of concentration. In 180 °C conditions, 0.5% AERB acted as a prooxidant, whereas other concentrations of AERB acted as antioxidants. In the case of riboflavin photosensitized O/W emulsions, AERB showed antioxidant properties irrespective of concentration. Antioxidant abilities of AERB are affected by the food matrix, including bulk oil and O/W emulsions, and concentrations of AERB, even though diverse phenolic compounds may display high antioxidant properties in in vitro assays.",Journal of food science,"['D000975', 'D001628', 'D002681', 'D003296', 'D003314', 'D002523', 'D004655', 'D001467', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D007564', 'D015227', 'D010084', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D017382', 'D056910', 'D014867']","['Antioxidants', 'Beverages', 'China', 'Cooking', 'Corn Oil', 'Edible Grain', 'Emulsions', 'Hordeum', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Republic of Korea', 'Water']",Antioxidant Properties of Aqueous Extract of Roasted Hulled Barley in Bulk Oil or Oil-in-Water Emulsion Matrix.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408834,2016
26340625,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with its nutraceutical characteristics substantially contributes as a major nutrient to the health benefit of the Mediterranean diet. Unfortunately, the adulteration of EVOO with less expensive oils (e.g., peanut and corn oils), has become one of the biggest source of agricultural fraud in the European Union, with important health implications for consumers, mainly due to the introduction of seed oil-derived allergens causing, especially in children, severe food allergy phenomena. In this regard, revealing adulterations of EVOO is of fundamental importance for health care and prevention reasons, especially in children. To this aim, effective analytical methods to assess EVOO purity are necessary. Here, we propose a simple, rapid, robust and very sensitive method for non-specialized mass spectrometric laboratory, based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC), principal component (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analyses, to reveal corn oil (CO) adulterations in EVOO at very low levels (down to 0.5%).

The effectiveness of functional barrier layers was investigated in coloured polystyrene (PS) bowls due to their intended condition of use with hot liquids such as soups or stew. Migration experiments were performed over a 10-day period using USFDA-recommended food simulants (10% ethanol, 50% ethanol, corn oil and Miglyol) along with several other food oils. At the end of the 10 days, solvent dyes had migrated from the PS bowls at 12, 1 and 31,000 ng cm(-)(2) into coconut oil, palm kernel oil and Miglyol respectively, and in coconut oil and Miglyol the colour change was visible to the human eye. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the functional barrier was no longer intact for the bowls exposed to coconut oil, palm kernel oil, Miglyol, 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk. Additional tests showed that 1-dodecanol, a lauryl alcohol derived from palm kernel oil and coconut oil, was present in the PS bowls at an average concentration of 11 mg kg(-1). This compound is likely to have been used as a dispersing agent for the solvent dye and aided the migration of the solvent dye from the PS bowl into the food simulant. The solvent dye was not found in the 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk food simulants above their respective limits of detection, which is likely to be due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions. A disrupted barrier layer is of concern because if there are unregulated materials in the inner layers of the laminate, they may migrate to food, and therefore be considered unapproved food additives resulting in the food being deemed adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.","Food additives & contaminants.

24906357,"Turnout gear provides protection against dermal exposure to contaminants during firefighting; however, the level of protection is unknown. We explored the dermal contribution to the systemic dose of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters during suppression and overhaul of controlled structure burns. The study was organized into two rounds, three controlled burns per round, and five firefighters per burn. The firefighters wore new or laundered turnout gear tested before each burn to ensure lack of PAH contamination. To ensure that any increase in systemic PAH levels after the burn was the result of dermal rather than inhalation exposure, the firefighters did not remove their self-contained breathing apparatus until overhaul was completed and they were >30 m upwind from the burn structure. Specimens were collected before and at intervals after the burn for biomarker analysis. Urine was analyzed for phenanthrene equivalents using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a benzene metabolite (s-phenylmercapturic acid) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; both were adjusted by creatinine. Exhaled breath collected on thermal desorption tubes was analyzed for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We collected personal air samples during the burn and skin wipe samples (corn oil medium) on several body sites before and after the burn. The air and wipe samples were analyzed for PAHs using a liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. We explored possible changes in external exposures or biomarkers over time and the relationships between these variables using non-parametric sign tests and Spearman tests, respectively. We found significantly elevated (P < 0.05) post-exposure breath concentrations of benzene compared with pre-exposure concentrations for both rounds. We also found significantly elevated post-exposure levels of PAHs on the neck compared with pre-exposure levels for round 1. We found statistically significant positive correlations between external exposures (i.e. personal air concentrations of PAHs) and biomarkers (i.e. change in urinary PAH metabolite levels in round 1 and change in breath concentrations of benzene in round 2). The results suggest that firefighters wearing full protective ensembles absorbed combustion products into their bodies. The PAHs most likely entered firefighters' bodies through their skin, with the neck being the primary site of exposure and absorption due to the lower level of dermal protection afforded by hoods. Aromatic hydrocarbons could have been absorbed dermally during firefighting or inhaled during the doffing of gear that was off-gassing contaminants.

The purpose of this research was to use an environmentally relevant mixture of pyrethroids to assess their cumulative effect on motor activity and develop kinetic profiles for these pyrethroids and their hydrolytic metabolites in brain and blood of rats. Rats were dosed orally at one of two levels (1.5× or 5.0× the calculated dose that decreases rat motor activity by 30%) with a mixture of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, cis-/trans-permethrin, and β-cyfluthrin in corn oil. At 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24h after dosing, the motor activity of each animal was assessed and the animals sacrificed. Concentrations of pyrethroids in brain and blood, and the following metabolites: cis-/trans-dichlorovinyl-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid, and cis-dibromovinyl-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using this pyrethroid mixture in rats, the results suggest there is greater metabolism of trans-permethrin prior to entering the systemic circulatory system. All pyrethroids had tissue half-lives (t1/2) of less than 5h, excepting esfenvalerate in brain. At early time points, relative pyrethroid brain concentrations approximated their dose mixture proportions and a sigmoidal Emax model described the relationship between motor activity decrease and total pyrethroid brain concentration. In blood, the t1/2's of the cyclopropane metabolites were longer than the phenoxybenzoic metabolites. However, relative to their respective precursors, concentrations of the phenoxybenzoic acids were much higher than concentrations of the cyclopropane metabolites. Brain concentrations of all metabolites were low relative to blood concentrations.

Metabolomic profiles of serum samples were determined from extracted supernatants that were split and run on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms, for identification and relative quantification of small metabolites. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Among dog groups, there was no change in total-lean-body weight, or in serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations, based on time or dietary treatment. Serum concentrations of carnitine metabolites were decreased in geriatric (>7 years) vs. mature adult (≤ 7 years) dogs, and supplementation with L-carnitine attenuated the effects of aging. The ratio of PUFA to SFA was significantly greater in mature dogs at baseline (P ≤ 0.05). Serum concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA increased in a dose-dependent manner. Dogs consuming treatment food 2 also had increased serum concentrations of lauric and myristic FA, and decreased concentrations of SFA, MUFA, and arachidonate (all P ≤ 0.05) and their PUFA to SFA ratio increased. In summary, dietary MCT, fish oil, and L-carnitine counterbalanced the effects of aging on circulating concentrations of these compounds.",PloS one,"['D000367', 'D000818', 'D001835', 'D002331', 'D004032', 'D004285', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D005527', 'D012709', 'D014280']","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Carnitine', 'Diet', 'Dogs', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Food, Fortified', 'Serum Albumin', 'Triglycerides']","Feeding healthy beagles medium-chain triglycerides, fish oil, and carnitine offsets age-related changes in serum fatty acids and carnitine metabolites.","[None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000494']","[None, None, None, 'blood', None, 'metabolism', 'blood', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145181,2013
22829604,"Studies using dietary supplementation of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids (FA) in horses report inconsistent anti-inflammatory results but consistently report an increase in plasma arachidonic acid (C20:4), the major substrate of cyclooxygenase (COX) II inflammatory pathway. Conjugated linoleic acid has shown anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory and food animal species, but effects of CLA supplementation in horses have not been reported. Our objective was to determine the effects of CLA supplementation on plasma CLA and C20:4 and body fat in healthy horses at maintenance. In a crossover study, 12 mature mares were blocked by breed, age, and BCS and separated into 2 treatment groups (n = 6/group). Groups were fed CLA and corn oil (CO; isocaloric control) for two 6-wk feeding periods, separated by a 4-wk period during which treatment was withheld. Corn oil or CLA supplement (55% mixed CLA isomers) was incorporated into diets at 0.01% BW/d. Mares were fed individually and restricted to dry lots to control forage intake. Rump fat thickness (RFT), BW, and BCS were measured before (d 0) and after (d 42) each feeding period. Blood was collected on d 0, 14, 28, and 42 of each 6-wk period for GLC analysis of plasma CLA isomers (cis-9, trans-11; trans-10, cis-12; and trans-9, trans-11) and C20:4. An ANOVA was conducted to compare the response of RFT, BW, and BCS of CLA-treated and control mares. A mixed methods analysis with repeated measures was used to detect differences in plasma FA concentrations. There were no differences in BW, RFT, or BCS between treatment groups. All CLA isomers present in the CLA supplement were greater in plasma of horses fed CLA compared with controls (P < 0.01). Additionally, plasma concentrations of C20:4 were decreased in horses fed CLA (P < 0.05). This decline in C20:4 may impact the COX II pathway and warrants further investigation. These results suggest that in an equine model, dietary CLA increases circulating concentrations of supplemented CLA isomers and decreases circulating C20:4. Examining physiological effects of CLA supplementation in horses at varying levels of growth, exercise, and progression of joint disease may offer insight to potential benefits of CLA in the horse.",Journal of animal science,"['D000273', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D016718', 'D002853', 'D018592', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D006736', 'D044243']","['Adipose Tissue', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Horses', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated']",Dietary supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid in horses increases plasma conjugated linoleic acid and decreases plasma arachidonic acid but does not alter body fat.,"['Q000378', None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000662', None, 'Q000662', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008']","['metabolism', None, None, 'blood', 'veterinary', None, 'veterinary', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829604,2013

No deaths occurred in any groups, and there were no changes from controls in detailed clinical observations, body weights, and food consumption in any treatment groups. Moreover, no treatment-related histopathological changes were found in any organs examined at the end of the administration period and at the end of the recovery period. Blackish feces and black contents of the stomach and large intestine were observed in males and females at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the treatment group. There were no changes from controls in the liver and spleen weights at the end of the administration period, but those weights in males in the 1,000 mg/kg/day group increased at the end of the recovery period. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, fullerene C60 were not detected in the liver, spleen or kidney at the end of the administration period and also at the end of the recovery period. In conclusion, the present study revealed no toxicological effects of fullerene C60; however, the slight increases in liver and spleen weights after the 14-day recovery period may be because of the influence of fullerene C60 oral administration.

21424962,"Trace element analysis plays an important role in oil characterisation and in the detection of oil adulteration because the quality of edible oils and fats is affected by their trace metal content. In this study, the quantification of selected metals in various oils and fats (rice oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, olive oil, light margarine, regular margarine and butter) was carried out using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after sample emulsification. FAAS was used to determine the Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe levels in the samples, while GFAAS was used for quantifying Cr, Ni, As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn, as these elements appeared in the samples at much lower concentrations. Tween-80 and Triton X-100 were employed as surfactants, and emulsions were prepared by a conventional method that involved heating and mixing of the constituents. Complete stabilisation was achieved through magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The evaluated figures of merit were linearity, accuracy and sensitivity, which were determined by the characteristic concentration and mass. Analysis of spiked samples demonstrated accuracy, which ranged from 90% (Na) to 112% (Fe) for FAAS and from 83% (Cd) to 121% (Pb) for GFAAS measurements. Atomic absorption spectrometry proved to be a promising approach for the analysis of metals in emulsified edible oils and fats. Additionally, under appropriate emulsification conditions (formulation, stirring time and temperature), the emulsions were homogeneous, had excellent stability, and had appropriate viscosity.

21314472,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are commonly used as commercial flame retardants in a variety of products, including plastics and textiles. Previous studies in our laboratory, and in the literature, showed that exposure to a specific PBDE congener (PBDE 47) during a critical period of brain development may lead to developmental delays and hyperactivity in adulthood. To date, the underlying causes of these behavioral alterations are unknown, although in vitro studies linked PBDEs with potential alterations in neurotransmitter levels, particularly acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA). Alterations in DA function have also been noted in cases of hyperactivity in rodents and humans. The current study examined monoamine levels in male mice acutely exposed to corn oil vehicle or PBDE 47 (1, 10, or 30 mg/kg) on postnatal day (PND) 10. Animals were sacrificed on PND 15, PND 20, and in adulthood (131-159 days old). The cortex, striatum, and cerebellum were isolated and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the concentration of monoamines within each brain region. A statistically significant increase in DA levels was seen within the cortex, regardless of age, but only in the 10-mg/kg PBDE treatment group. While these effects did not show a monotonic dose response, we previously reported hyperactivity in littermates in the same dose group, but not at the lower or higher dose. Thus, early developmental exposure to PBDE 47 alters the levels of cortical DA in male mice, which may correlate with behavioral observations in littermates.",Drug and chemical toxicology,"['D000109', 'D000818', 'D000833', 'D001921', 'D001923', 'D002531', 'D002540', 'D002851', 'D003342', 'D004298', 'D005260', 'D005411', 'D055768', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D008810', 'D023382']","['Acetylcholine', 'Animals', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Dopamine', 'Female', 'Flame Retardants', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",Neurochemical changes following a single dose of polybrominated diphenyl ether 47 in mice.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000633', None, None, None, None]","['analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'toxicity', 'toxicity', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21314472,2011

In a second separation step, a 10 cm x 2 mm i.d. column packed with activated aluminum oxide separates the long chain n-alkanes from the fraction of the iso-alkanes which is transferred to GC-FID by the on-column interface and the retention gap technique. The retained n-alkanes are removed by flushing with iso-octane.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000473', 'D000537', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D003314', 'D004784', 'D005410', 'D005504', 'D008899', 'D010232']","['Alkanes', 'Aluminum Oxide', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Corn Oil', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Flame Ionization', 'Food Analysis', 'Mineral Oil', 'Paraffin']",Activated aluminum oxide selectively retaining long chain n-alkanes: Part II.

19101834,"Trichloroethane functions in cosmetics as a solvent. Although Trichloroethane has been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in cosmetic products, an industry survey found that it is not in current use in the cosmetic industry. Trichloroethane is considered a Class I ozone-depleting substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its use is prohibited in the United States, unless considered essential. The FDA has stated that Trichloroethane's use in cosmetics is considered nonessential. Trichloroethane is detected by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and gas-liquid chromatography. In rats, Trichloroethane, whether inhaled or injected, is mostly expelled intact from the body through exhalation. A very small percentage is excreted in the urine. In humans, Trichloroethane is rapidly absorbed through the skin and eliminated in exhaled air and a very small percentage is excreted in urine. Inhaled Trichloroethane is eliminated in exhaled air. Acute oral LD(50) values have been reported as follows: 12.3 g/kg in male rats; 10.3 g/kg in female rats; 11.24 g/kg in female mice; 5.66 g/kg in female rabbits; and 9.47 g/kg in male guinea pigs. Acute toxicity studies using other routes of exposure, including subcutaneous injection and inhalation, produced no evidence of significant toxicity, except at very high exposure levels. Continuous inhalation exposure of rabbits to 750 mg/m(3) for 90 days did not produce any signs of toxicity. Continuous exposure of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and monkeys to 500 ppm Trichloroethane for 6 months did not produce any signs of toxicity. Other short-term and subchronic inhalation exposures confirmed acute and short-term exposure findings that the toxic effects of inhalation were a function of both concentration and time. Rats receiving 750 or 1500 mg/kg day(- 1) Trichloroethane in corn oil by oral gavage 5 days per week for 78 weeks had reduced body weights and early mortality. Reduced body weights, decreased survival rates, and early mortality (in females) were found in mice dosed with 3000 or 6000 mg/kg day(- 1) (over the last 58 weeks; lower doses were administered for the first 20 weeks). Mice exposed to prolonged periods of Trichloroethane in an inhalation chamber had increased motor activity at levels up to 5000 ppm. Further increase of concentration of exposure resulted in less of an increase of motor activity until motor activity began to fall below normal at 10,000 ppm. Adverse effects on motor activity in rats were seen at exposures as low as 3000 ppm for 4 h. Rabbits had slight reddening and scaling after 10 24-h applications to abdominal skin of Trichloroethane mixed with 2.4% to 3.0% dioxane, and slight to moderate erythema, slight edema, and slight exfoliation was observed when 75% Trichloroethane and 25% tetrachloroethylene were applied to rabbit ears for 11 days. Undiluted Trichloroethane applied to the clipped backs of guinea pigs produced histopathologic damage in the epidermis. A primary irritation index of 5.22 (out of 8) was reported in rabbits. Trichloroethane applied to the eyes of rabbits resulted in transient irritation and apparent pain, but no corneal damage. There was no effect on gestation, pup survival, or growth in mice given Trichloroethane in drinking water at up to 5.83 mg/ml during mating and/or gestation. Rats exhibited no or minimal effects of ingestion of Trichloroethane up to 30 ppm in drinking water during mating and/or gestation. There was no effect on gestation, pup survival, or growth in mice or rats inhaling 875 ppm Trichloroethane. However, prenatal exposure of rodents to Trichloroethane can produce developmental toxicity in the form of delayed development in the offspring. Trichloroethane has been found to be mutagenic in the Ames assay in some studies and not mutagenic in others. Trichloroethane induced transformations in Fischer rat embryo cell system at 99 mu M, was not mutagenic using the mouse lymphoma assay at up to 0.51 mu g/ml, was equivocal in that assay when tested with S9, and was also equivocal in a sister-chromatid exchange assay using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells with and without S9. Mice ingesting 80,000 ppm Trichloroethane in their drinking water had an increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes. A peripheral blood micronucleus test in female mice was negative. Trichloroethane was not carcinogenic to rats when administered 1500 mg/kg by oral gavage 5 days/week for 78 weeks or in mice administered 6000 mg/kg. Exposure to 1500 ppm Trichloroethane vapor for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 2 years likewise gave no indications of oncogenic effects in rats or mice. People who have been exposed to Trichloroethane have reported dizziness, lassitude, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, peripheral vascular collapse, impaired postural control, mild encephalopathy, perioral tingling, burning on the tongue and discomfort in the hands and feet. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel recognizes that Trichloroethane (1,1,1-Trichloroethane) has been declared a Class I ozone-depleting substance by the EPA and its use is limited to essential products. The FDA has determined that use of Trichloroethane in aerosol cosmetic products is considered nonessential. At issue for this assessment is the safety of direct exposure to individuals as a result of exposure to cosmetic products that may contain Trichloroethane. The Expert Panel found the available data to be sufficient to support the safety of Trichloroethane as a solvent in cosmetic products.",International journal of toxicology,"['D000818', 'D003257', 'D003358', 'D006801', 'D012997', 'D018675', 'D014240']","['Animals', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Cosmetics', 'Humans', 'Solvents', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Trichloroethanes']",Final report on the safety assessment of Trichloroethane.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19101834,2009

The obtained mean Phen and FRAP values for acetonic extracts of olive oils, rapeseed, rice and four sunflower oils (39.3-336.5 and 39.5-339.6 micromol Fe/100g) were higher than for methanolic extracts (22.8-307.3 and 23.5-300.1 micromol Fe/100g). However, antioxidant capacities of methanolic extracts of corn oil, blended oils and two sunflower oils with garden green flowers (56.5-312.9 and 53.9-306.5 micromol Fe/100g for Phen and FRAP methods, respectively) were higher than for acetonic extracts of these oils (54.2-249.2 and 52.9-244.7 micromol Fe/100g for Phen and FRAP methods, respectively). There is a linear and significant correlation between these two analytical methods (r=0.9989 and 0.9986 for acetonic and methanolic extracts).

18620402,"Among cereals, only maize has not only a high amount of carotenoids, tocopherols, and oil content but also is rich in starch and protein content compared with other major food crops, such as rice and wheat. The present investigation was made primarily to assess the genetic variability for nutritionally important traits in 87 elite maize inbreds representing major heterotic groups in China. Carotenoid and tocopherol fractions were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), whereas oil, starch, and protein contents were detected by a VECTER22/N near-infrared analyzer. Significant interactions between genotypes and years were observed for all the traits. The pooled mean values of beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were 0.449, 0.876, 0.121, 5.803, 3.048, and 10.298 microg g (-1), respectively, whereas the combined mean performance of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and total tocopherols were 23.98, 32.90, 2.189, and 59.55 microg g (-1), respectively. The average protein, starch, and oil contents were observed to be 12.28, 64.51, and 3.55%, respectively. High level of heritability estimates were observed for all the traits and ranged from 65.6% (protein content) to 92.5% (alpha/gamma-tocopherol ratio). Most of the traits studied in this experiment were either significantly positive correlated or independent.

18464095,"This article describes the laboratory assessment of a hand and surface wipe sampling method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The analytical method employed extraction of the wipe samples into dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) flourometric detection of pyrene, a predominant PAH in used gasoline engine oils (UGEO). Recovery of pyrene was evaluated for two different sampling media by first contaminating the hands of a small number of volunteers with UGEO, followed by applying a small amount of corn oil to the palms, and by wiping the skin with a Whatman cellulostic filter paper or a polyester fabric wipe (i.e., Alpha wipes). In summary, using either Whatman or Alpha wipes, the mean recovery of pyrene from the UGEO that was applied to the hands and contained within three consecutive wipes was 69% and 54%, respectively. However, the relative recovery of the first to second wipe was on average 47% and 75% for the two media, respectively. These results indicate that the Alpha wipes were more efficient at recovering pyrene in the first wipe but less efficient overall when all three consecutive samples were included. Even though this sampling was performed in a controlled laboratory environment, the minimum and maximum amount of pyrene recovered in the individual composite samples using either method spanned a range of twofold. Overall, intra-and interpersonal variability, as measured by coefficient of variation, were 22% and 19%, respectively, and were not statistically different by type of media used. This method was used in a pilot field survey to sample the hands of 18 automotive repair technicians and 18 office workers. Detectable amounts of pyrene (>0.2 microg/sample) were found on the hands of 61% and 0% of these two groups, respectively, with the highest measured quantity equal to 1.06 microg.

Flour dough containing soy flour at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was fried in corn oil at 180 degrees C for 2.5 min, and a total of 60 fryings were performed every 30 min. The oxidation of oil was determined by contents of free fatty acids (FFA), conjugated dienoic acids (CDA), polar compounds, and p-anisidine values (PAV). Tocopherols and phospholipids (PLs) in the oil were determined by HPLC. Tocopherols were present in corn oil at 1000 ppm before frying and increased after the first frying of dough containing soy flour due to tocopherol transfer from soy-flour-added dough to the oil during frying. However, as the oil repeated frying, tocopherol contents decreased and its degradation rate was higher in the oil that fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil that fried the dough without soy flour. PL was not detected in corn oil before and after frying. As the oil repeated frying, FFA, CDA, and polar compounds contents, and PAV of frying oil increased due to the oil oxidation. The values were higher in the oil which fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil fried the dough without soy flour, indicating the acceleration of oil oxidation by soy flour added to dough.

17194553,"The present study investigated the protective effects of zinc in attenuating the altered activities of drug metabolizing enzymes in the livers of rats intoxicated with chlorpyrifos. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received oral chlorpyrifos treatment (at a dose level of 13.5 mg/kg body weight in corn oil every alternate day), zinc supplementation alone (at a dose level of 227 mg/l in drinking water), or combined chlorpyrifos plus zinc treatments for a total duration of 8 weeks. The effects of different treatments were studied on the specific activities of various drug metabolizing enzymes including cytochrome P(450), cytochrome b(5), NADPH cytochrome-c-reductase, NADH cytochrome-c-reductase, aminopyrene-N-demethylase (APD) and aromatic hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). Additionally, serum zinc levels were also determined in each of the treatment groups at the end of the study. Chlorpyrifos treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the serum zinc concentrations. Analogous to these changes, we observed significant depression in the activities of majority of the drug metabolizing enzymes investigated in the present study, except for AHH, where the decrease in enzyme activity was not statistically significant. However, zinc treatment to chlorpyrifos treated animals effectively restored the depressed serum zinc levels to within normal limits. Similarly, co-administration of zinc to chlorpyrifos intoxicated animals normalized the enzymatic activities of cytochrome P(450), NADPH cytochrome-c-reductase and NADH cytochrome-c-reductase within normal range.

16787045,"Alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs) are suspected cancer promoters and clastogens, which have raised concerns about the safety of irradiated foods. Currently there are few data on the metabolism of 2-ACBs, which makes it very important to study this aspect of 2-ACBs to evaluate their safety. The objectives of this experiment were to quantify 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB; formed from palmitic acid) in the feces and adipose tissue of rats and to check for metabolites of 2-DCB in the urine. Six female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 2-DCB (5 mg/day) in corn oil for 5 days via gavage. Six control rats did not receive 2-DCB. Feces and urine were collected daily, whereas adipose tissue was collected upon euthanasia. Hexane extracts of feces and adipose tissue were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Urine with and without added beta-glucuronidase was monitored for glucuronide complexes by hexane extraction and GC-MS. The total amount of 2-DCB recovered in feces was 1.78 +/- 0.63 mg at the end of 5 days, which represents between 3 and 11% of the total 2-DCB administered. The total amount recovered in the adipose tissue was 0.08 +/- 0.01 mg, which was approximately 0.33% of the total 2-DCB administered. No metabolites were recovered in any of the urine extracts.

16781860,"Adverse health effects such as cancer and toxicity may be attributed to consumption of chemically contaminated food rich in fat. This leads to a larger intake and retention of lipophilic toxic chemicals in the body with an increase in risks to human health. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of dietary fat on disposition and metabolism of fluoranthene (FLA), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. FLA was administered to F-344 rats in monounsaturated (peanut oil), polyunsaturated (corn oil) and saturated (coconut oil) fats at doses of 50 and 100 microg/kg via oral gavage. Blood, small intestine, liver, lung, testis, adipose tissue, urine and feces were collected at various time points' post-FLA exposure. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for FLA parent compound and metabolites. DNA was isolated from the tissues and subjected to (32)P-post labeling to measure FLA-DNA adducts. The concentrations of unchanged FLA (FLA parent compound) and its metabolites showed an increase for the saturated fat treatment group compared with mono- and polyunsaturated fat groups. The FLA-DNA adduct concentrations were high in tissues of rats that received FLA through saturated fat. The toxicokinetic parameters, concentrations of FLA metabolites and FLA-DNA adduct showed a dose-dependent increase, and this increase was statistically significant (P<.05) for saturated fat. These findings clearly demonstrate that the high residence time of FLA parent compound in saturated fat allows extensive metabolism, contributing reactive metabolites of FLA that bind with DNA and causing marked damage in a long-term exposure scenario.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D018736', 'D004041', 'D004042', 'D005449', 'D007583', 'D008099', 'D008168', 'D008297', 'D051381', 'D011916', 'D013737', 'D014018']","['Animals', 'DNA Adducts', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Fluorenes', 'Jejunum', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Testis', 'Tissue Distribution']",Effect of dietary fat on metabolism and DNA adduct formation after acute oral exposure of F-344 rats to fluoranthene.,"[None, 'Q000096', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None]","[None, 'biosynthesis', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16781860,2007

A meal containing applesauce, corn oil, and either water-soluble beadlets (WSB) or Dunaliella salina (DS) as a BC source was subjected to simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. BC isomers were stable during digestion, and the efficiency of micellarization of cis-BC isomers exceeded that of all-trans-BC isomers. The cellular profile of carotenoids generally reflected that in micelles generated during digestion, and intracellular isomerization was minimal.

Male Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats (250-300 g) were administered with fivefold dose range of CF (74-370 mg/kg, ip), and TCE (250-1250 mg/kg, ip) in corn oil and sevenfold dose range of AA (5-35 mg/kg, ip) in distilled water. Liver injury was assessed by plasma alanine amino transferase (ALT) activity and liver tissue repair was measured by (3) H-thymidine incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA. Blood and liver levels of parent compounds and two major metabolites of TCE [trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and trichloroethanol (TCOH)] were quantified by gas chromatography. Blood and liver CF and AA levels after TM were similar to CF alone or AA alone, respectively. However, the TCE levels in blood and liver were substantially decreased after TM in a dose-dependent fashion compared to TCE alone. Decreased plasma and liver TCE levels were consistent with decreased production of metabolites and elevated urinary excretion of TCE. The antagonistic interaction resulted in lower liver injury than the summation of injury caused by the individual components at all three-dose levels. On the other hand, tissue repair showed a dose-response leading to regression of injury. Although the liver injury was lower and progression was contained by timely tissue repair, 50% mortality occurred only with the high dose combination, which is several fold higher than environmental levels. The mortality could be due to the central nervous system toxicity.

After the administration of labelled triolein to rats fed the fat-free diet, the incorporation (dpm/g) into total lipids of the liver and adipose tissue each reached the maximum in 8 h and was seven times higher in the adipose tissue than in the liver. The half-lives of total lipid radioactivities during the decreasing phases were 0.39 and 2.58 d, respectively, in the rapid and slow phases of the decay curve in the liver, and 4.78 d in only one phase of the adipose tissue. Radioactivity after administration of labelled triolein was mostly found in the oleic acid in the tissues. The half-life of oleic acid was 3.92 d in the adipose tissues. These half-lives were similar in both dietary groups. Thus, although dietary corn oil reduced the triolein incorporation to cellular lipids in comparison to the fat-free diet, it did not affect these half-lives. The labelled triacylglycerol-oleic acid stayed abundantly intact for a long time in the adipose tissue and was scarcely changed to other fatty acids, whereas it was slightly incorporated into total lipids and quickly metabolized in the liver.

The analytical techniques used were silica gel column chromatography and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The decrease in ox-TG during refining (42.3% on average) was accompanied by an increase in triglyceride oligopolymers (TGP). The inverse correlation between the two lipid groups suggests that the decrease in ox-TG during refining was due in part to the occurrence of polymerization reactions. An inverse correlation was also found between the percentage sum of ox-TG + TGP and percent TGP, indicating that a part of the ox-TG also underwent degradation or transformation reactions.

14554102,"We have previously reported that short-term, single exposure to a high dose of tributyltin (TBT), a widely used antifouling biocide, inhibited both the in vivo metabolism and metabolic activation of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in fish; (BaP), in turn, stimulated TBT metabolism. Here, we provide further mechanistic evidence of mutual metabolic interactions between BaP and TBT in response to long-term, repeated exposures to low doses. Juvenile Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) received 10 separate i.p. injections (a single injection every 6 days) of BaP (3 mg/kg), TBT (0.3 mg/kg), or both in combination; control fish received corn oil vehicle only. Two days after the 2nd (Day 8), 6th (Day 32), and 10th dose (Day 56), blood, bile, and liver samples were collected and analyzed for a suite of biomarkers. HPLC/fluorescence analysis indicated that TBT cotreatment inhibited the formation of (+)-anti-BaP diol-epoxide adducts with plasma albumin (53%, Day 8), hepatic DNA (27%, Day 32), or both albumin and globin (50 and 58%, Day 56) compared to BaP alone. This antagonistic interaction was associated with a time-dependent modulation (inhibition at Day 8, enhancement at Day 32) of both cytochrome P450 (P450)1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity and biliary BaP metabolite formation. TBT cotreatment also inhibited (39%) the BaP-mediated induction of hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity observed at Day 8. Treatment with TBT alone increased EROD activity (60%) at Day 32, but decreased both GST activity (70 and 37%) and glutathione content (24% and 16%) at Days 32 and 56, respectively. GC/MS analysis revealed that, at Day 56, BaP cotreatment increased (200%) the levels of biliary butyltin compounds, including mono- and dibutyltin metabolites. This potentiative interaction was associated with a protective effect of BaP cotreatment against the TBT-mediated decreases in GST activity and glutathione content. The current results demonstrate that, whereas TBT inhibited BaP bioactivation via a time-dependent modulation of P4501A induction, BaP stimulated the Phase II metabolism of TBT and/or its biliary excretion.

This study was performed to investigate the biotransformation and toxicokinetics of this important food contaminant. Male (n=18) and female (n=18) F344 rats were administered a single dose of OTA (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) in corn oil by gavage. Animals (n=3) were sacrificed 24, 48, 72, 96, 672, and 1,344 hours after OTA administration and concentrations of OTA and OTA-metabolites in urine, feces, blood, liver, and kidney were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection and/or by LC-MS/MS. Recovery of unchanged OTA in urine amounted to 2.1% of dose in males and 5.2% in females within 96 h. In feces, only 5.5% respectively 1.5% of dose were recovered. The major metabolite detected was OTalpha; low concentrations of OTA-glucosides were also present in urine. The maximal blood levels of OTA were observed between 24 and 48 h after administration and were appromixately 4.6 micromol/l in males and 6.0 micromol/l in females. Elimination of OTA from blood followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of approximately 230 h. In liver of both male and female rats, OTA-concentrations were less than 12 pmol/g tissue, with a maximum at 24 h after administration. In contrast, OTA accumulated in the kidneys, reaching a concentration of 480 pmol/g tissue in males 24 h after OTA-administration. Generally, tissue concentrations in males were higher than in females. OTalpha was not detected in liver and kidney tissue of rats administered OTA, and the OTalpha concentrations in blood were low (10-15 nmol/l).

Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured to assess liver injury, and 3H-thymidine (3H-T) incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA was measured as an index of liver regeneration over a time course of 0-72 h. Male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats received single ip injection of 5-fold dose range of CHCl(3) (74, 185 and 370 mg/kg) in corn oil (maximum 0.5 ml/kg) and 7-fold dose range of AA (5, 20 and 35 mg/kg) in distilled water simultaneously. The doses for BM were selected from individual toxicity studies of CHCl(3) alone [Int. J. Toxicol. 22 (2003) 25], and AA alone [Reg. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 19 (1999) 165]. Since the highest dose of each treatment (CHCl(3)- 740 and AA- 50 mg/kg) yielded mortality due to the suppressed tissue repair followed by liver failure, this dose was omitted for BM. The levels of CHCl(3) (30-360 min) and AA (5-60 min) were quantified in blood and liver by gas chromatography (GC). The liver injury was more than additive after BM compared to CHCl(3) alone or AA alone at highest dose combination (370+35 mg/kg), which peaked at 24 h. The augmented liver injury observed with BM was consistent with the quantitation data. Though the liver injury was higher, the greater stimulation of tissue repair kept injury from progressing, and rescued the rats from hepatic failure and death. At lower dose combinations, the liver injury was no more than additive. Results of the present study suggest that liver tissue repair, in which liver tissue lost to injury is promptly replaced, plays a pivotal role in the final outcome of liver injury after exposure to BM of CHCl(3) and AA.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D000410', 'D000818', 'D056486', 'D002725', 'D002849', 'D004247', 'D004305', 'D004357', 'D007274', 'D008099', 'D008115', 'D008136', 'D008297', 'D020005', 'D051381', 'D017207']","['Alanine Transaminase', 'Animals', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Chloroform', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'DNA', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Liver', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Longevity', 'Male', 'Propanols', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",Tissue repair plays pivotal role in final outcome of liver injury following chloroform and allyl alcohol binary mixture.,"['Q000097', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000096', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000008', None, None]","['blood', None, 'blood', 'administration & dosage', None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12842180,2003
12661024,"Maize oil commands a premium price and is thus a target for adulteration with cheaper vegetable oils. Detection of this activity presents a particular challenge to the analyst because of the natural variability in the fatty acid composition of maize oils and because of their high sterol and tocopherol contents. This paper describes a method that allows detection of adulteration at concentrations of just 5% (m/m), based on the Mahalanobis distances of the principal component scores of the delta(13)C values of major and minor vegetable oil components. The method makes use of a database consisting of delta(13)C values and relative abundances of the major fatty acyl components of over 150 vegetable oils. The sterols and tocopherols of 16 maize oils and 6 potential adulterant oils were found to be depleted in (13)C by a constant amount relative to the bulk oil. Moreover, since maize oil contains particularly high levels of sterols and tocopherols, their delta(13)C values were not significantly altered when groundnut oil was added up to 20% (m/m) and it is possible to use the values for the minor components to predict the values that would be expected in a pure oil; therefore, comparison of the predicted values with those obtained experimentally allows adulteration to be detected. A refinement involved performing a discriminant analysis on the delta(13)C values of the bulk oil and the major fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) and using the Mahalanobis distances to determine the percentage of adulterant oil present. This approach may be refined further by including the delta(13)C values of the minor components in the discriminant analysis thereby increasing the sensitivity of the approach to concentrations at which adulteration would not be attractive economically.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002247', 'D003314', 'D005227', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D012680', 'D013261', 'D024505', 'D003313']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Corn Oil', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sterols', 'Tocopherols', 'Zea mays']",High-resolution detection of adulteration of maize oil using multi-component compound-specific delta13C values of major and minor components and discriminant analysis.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12661024,2003

Although the potential antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of this commercial preparation have been demonstrated, limited information is available on its digestion and absorption by humans. Stability of SCC was examined during simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. Three preparations were subjected to in vitro digestion: SCC in water, SCC in water + 10% corn oil, and SCC in applesauce. SCC components from raw material preparations and in digested samples were analyzed by C(18) HPLC with photodiode array detection. Cu(II)chlorin e(4), the major chlorin component of SCC, was relatively stable during simulated digestion. In contrast, greater than 90% of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) was degraded to undetermined products during digestion. Recovery of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) after digestion was increased by incorporation of SCC into applesauce, suggesting a protective role of the inclusion matrix for stabilization of labile SCC components. Accumulation of SCC derivatives was investigated by using differentiated cultures of the TC7 clone of the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line. Cellular accumulation from media containing 0.5 to 60 ppm SCC was linear with intracellular content ranging between 0.2 and 29.6 microg of total SCC per mg of cellular protein.

10959795,"Acute exposure to naphthalene produces severe bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis in mice, whereas subchronic exposure to naphthalene (200 mg/kg/7 days) fails to produce epithelial necrosis and renders the animals tolerant to subsequent challenge doses of naphthalene. Mechanisms responsible for the development of tolerance have not been delineated. The few studies exploring naphthalene tolerance focus on expression of microsomal enzymes and have yet to delve into expression of the hepatic detoxification enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18). Glutathione conjugation catalyzed by GSTs accounts for one of the two primary routes of naphthalene detoxification. In this study, we rigorously quantify levels of individual GST isozymes expressed within the livers and lungs of mice with acquired tolerance to naphthalene. Subchronic exposure to naphthalene increases the abundance of some hepatic GSTs to levels as much as 68% greater than controls. Naphthalene-tolerant mice displayed increases in mGSTM1 (51%), mGSTM2 (58%), and mGSTP1 (66%), whereas no significant difference in mGSTA3 was observed between exposed and control mice. Extracts of pulmonary tissues from naphthalene-tolerant mice showed minor increases in levels of mGSTP1 (7%) and Peak 8 isozyme (27%) and decreases in levels of mGSTM1 (31%), mGSTM2 (17%), and mGSTA3 (8%). The total enzymatic activity for the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was 22% lower in lung extracts from naphthalene-tolerant animals than in controls. These results indicate that induction of hepatic GSTs is substantial and may be an important factor in the development of tolerance to naphthalene.",Archives of toxicology,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D003314', 'D004305', 'D004361', 'D005982', 'D007527', 'D008099', 'D008168', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D009281', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Corn Oil', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Isoenzymes', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Quantification of individual glutathione S-transferase isozymes in hepatic and pulmonary tissues of naphthalene-tolerant mice.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000633', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, 'toxicity', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10959795,2001
10706245,"The ability of ozone gas (O3) to detoxify zearalenone (ZEN), a commonly occurring estrogenic mycotoxin, was assessed utilizing the mouse uterine weight bioassay. Solutions containing 12 ppm ZEN in water were ozonated for varying time periods (0, 0.5, and 5 min), then extracted with chloroform and evaporated to dryness. The residue was redissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed for ZEN. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of aliquots indicated a rapid degradation and decline in parent ZEN level with increasing time of ozone treatment. The acetonitrile solution containing the degraded ZEN residue was added to a known volume of corn oil and evaporated under nitrogen to eliminate the acetonitrile in the oil. Eighteen-day-old prepubertal female mice (B6C3F1 strain) were gavaged daily with the test chemicals in 50 microl of corn oil between d 18 and 23. Initial dose-response studies showed that a concentration of 60 microg ZEN/mouse/d produced uterine weights that were significantly higher than the uterine weights of control animals (2.7 times higher than that of the solvent control). Treatment groups for the ozonation study included: DES, 0.1 microg (positive control), untreated ZEN (60 microg), extraction control for ZEN (60 microg), 0.5 min ozone-treated ZEN (60 microg), 5 min ozone-treated ZEN (60 microg), solvent control (50 microl), and absolute control. Results showed the uterine weights of animals receiving the ozone-treated ZEN were not significantly affected. These findings were in agreement with HPLC analyses and suggested that ozone can prevent the estrogenic effects of this important mycotoxin in mice. Importantly, ozone treatment of contaminated whole grains may enable the practical detoxification and control of ZEN.

Current studies revealed that heat treatment (over the range of 100-175 degrees C) of corn fiber in either a convection oven or a vacuum oven caused only a modest reduction in the levels of the phytosterol components. However, these same heat pretreatments caused a considerable increase (up to 10-fold) in the levels (increasing from 0.34 wt % to a maximum of 3.64 wt % gamma-tocopherol in the oil) and yields (increasing from 5.4 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber to a maximum of 52.1 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber) of gamma-tocopherol in corn fiber oil. The main differences between the convection oven and vacuum oven pretreatments were associated with the disappearance of free fatty acids and free phytosterols at the higher temperature pretreatments in the vacuum oven, probably due to the lower boiling points of these lipids.

Fume samples from six different commercial cooking oils (safflower, olive, coconut, mustard, vegetable, and corn) frequently used in Taiwan were collected. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were extracted from the air samples and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Extracts of fumes from safflower oil, vegetable oil, and corn oil contained benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBahA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbFA), and benzo[a]anthracene (BaA). Concentrations of BaP, DbahA, BbFA, and BaA were 2.1, 2.8, 1.8, and 2.5 microg/m3 in fumes from safflower oil; 2.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.1 microg/m3 in vegetable oil; and 2.6, 2.4, 2.0, and 1.9 microg/m3 in corn oil, respectively. The authors constructed models to study the efficacy of table-edged fume extractors used commonly by Taiwanese restaurants. Concentrations of BaP were significantly decreased when the fume extractor was working (P<0.05) and the average reduction in percentage was 75%. The other identified PAHs were undetected. These results indicated that exposure to cooking oil fumes could possibly increase exposure to PAHs, which may be linked to an increased risk of lung cancer.

This study addresses several processing and protein recovery issues that are relevant to utilizing transgenic corn as a protein production system. The gus gene coding for beta-glucuronidase (rGUS) was stably integrated and expressed over four generations. The accumulation level of rGUS reached 0.4% of total extractable protein. Within the kernel, rGUS was preferentially accumulated in the germ even though a constitutive ubiquitin promoter was used to direct gus expression. Fourth-generation transgenic seed was used to investigate the effect of seed processing on the activity and the recovery of rGUS. Transgenic seed containing rGUS could be stored at an ambient temperature for up to two weeks and for at least three months at 10 degrees C without a significant loss of enzyme activity. rGUS exposed to dry heat was more stable in ground than in whole kernels. The enzyme stability was correlated with the moisture loss of the samples during the heating. Transgenic seed was dry-milled, fractionated, and hexane extracted to produce full-fat and defatted germ fractions. The results of the aqueous extraction of rGUS from ground kernels, full-fat germ, and defatted-germ samples revealed that approximately 10 times more rGUS per gram of solids could be extracted from the ground full-fat germ and defatted-germ than from the kernel samples. The extraction of corn oil from ground germ with hot hexane (60 degrees C) did not affect the extractable rGUS activity. rGUS was purified from ground kernels and full-fat germ extracts by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography.

The converse was true for ZEN, which is relatively insoluble in water. For ZEN, the maximum concentration found in CSL was 0.6 mg/kg compared with 2.2-4.8 mg/kg in germ, fibre and gluten fractions. Accordingly, an animal food byproduct composed mainly of pressed fibre and concentrated steep liquor was usually found to contain concentrations of all three mycotoxins above those existing in the input maize.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) were administered corn oil or the following EBIFs: propiconazole (400 mg/kg/day), vinclozolin (400 mg/kg/day), clotrimazole (100 mg/kg/day), or ketoconazole (100 mg/kg/day) for 3 days by oral gavage. Forty-eight hours following the final dose, a single bolus of parathion (0.4 mg/kg in corn oil) or malathion (150 mg/kg in corn oil) or corn oil alone was given po. The rats were terminated 12 hr following parathion or 4 hr following malathion dosing. Significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of BChE was observed with parathion and malathion only following clotrimazole treatment. In contrast, when a similar experiment was performed in bobwhite quail dosed with 12 mg/kg malathion following EBIF treatment, significant BChE inhibition was observed following treatment with vinclozolin or ketoconazole, but not with propiconazole or clotrimazole. Induction of cytochrome P450 in rat and quail liver by EBIFs was accompanied by enhanced oxidative desulfuration of malathion, parathion, and diazinon to toxic oxon products. Increased detoxication via oxidative dearylation/esterolytic clevage also occurred.

Conjugated linoleic acid occurs naturally in food and is present at higher concentrations in products from ruminant animals. Given that certain rumen microorganisms produce CLA from free linoleic acid, we studied the effect of feeding free or esterified linoleic acid on tissue CLA concentrations using conventional and germ-free rats. Conventional rats were fed a 5% (wt/wt) corn oil control diet alone or supplemented with 5% free linoleic acid or 8.63% corn oil (equivalent to 5% linoleic acid in triglyceride). Germ-free rats were fed autoclavable nonpurified diet alone or supplemented with 5% free linoleic acid. Analyses of CLA concentrations were performed on lipids extracted from liver, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and abdominal adipose tissue, and on liver phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions. Tissue CLA concentrations were higher in conventional rats fed free linoleic acid (the major isomers were cis-9, trans-11 and trans-9, cis-11) than in control animals. Conjugated linoleic acid concentrations in free linoleic acid-fed rats were maximal at 4 wk, and levels were 5-10 times higher than those of controls. Elevated CLA concentrations were also observed in liver phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions. In contrast, CLA concentrations in the tissues of germ-free rats were not affected by diet.

The assay for BaP-globin adducts was based on the release of tetrahydroxy-BaP (BaP-tetrols) from globin by mild acid hydrolysis. After extensive isolation, BaP-tetrols were quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography using fluorescence detection. BaP-tetrol levels were measured in rats dosed intraperitoneally with 242, 71 and 24 mumol BaP kg-1 body weight in corn oil. The formation of BaP-tetrols was not linear with dose. The lowest dose yielded adduct levels that represented the limits of sensitivity for the method, as performed in this laboratory.

We also examined the role of N:O-acetylation and the nitrenium ion in the genotoxicity of MeIQx, since these have been implicated in the activation of other aminoimidazoazaarenes (AIA) to DNA reactive species. Mice were given phenobarbital (PB), Aroclor 1254, beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or corn oil, i.p., followed 3-5 days later with oral administration of MeIQx. Induction of Aroclor and BNF produced DNA with 8-fold more adducts than either the corn oil-alone or PB-treated animals. Both corn oil-alone and PB-treated animals were similar. Four major adducts were found in all cases with no differences among inducers as judged by co-chromatography. Azido-MeIQx induced calf-thymus-DNA adducts produced identical adduct profiles to those seen for the mouse DNA. Similar adduct profiles were obtained from Salmonella TA98, and the nitroreductase deficient strains (TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6) exposed to MeIQx in the presence of Aroclor-induced-mouse-liver S9. Adduct frequencies in TA98/1,8-DNP6 were significantly lower than in TA98 and TA98NR. The data described in this report demonstrate that induction quantitatively increases adduct numbers but does not affect the types of DNA damage. These data also suggest that the same DNA reactive intermediates are formed in vivo as in vitro and support the hypothesis that the metabolism of MeIQx involves the P450I family of isozymes, N:O-acetyltransferases and possibly a nitrenium ion.

3401476,"Mice of the GR/A strain were fed four different isocaloric semipurified diets, enriched in either (1) saturated fatty acids (palm oil), or (2) polyunsaturated fatty acids (corn oil), or (3) palm oil plus cholesterol, or (4) a fat-poor diet containing only a minimal amount of essential fatty acids. We have studied the effects of these dietary lipids on the density profile and composition of the plasma lipoproteins and on the lipid composition and fluidity of (purified) lymphoid cell membranes in healthy mice and in mice bearing a transplanted lymphoid leukemia (GRSL). Tumor development in these mice occurred in the spleen and in ascites. While the fatty acid composition of the VLDL-triacylglycerols still strongly resembled the dietary lipids, the effects of the diets decreased in the order VLDL-triacylglycerols greater than HDL-phospholipids greater than plasma membrane phospholipids. Diet-induced differences in the latter fraction were virtually confined to the content of oleic acid and linoleic acid, and they were too small to affect the membrane fluidity, as measured by fluorescence polarization using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Healthy mice were almost irresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but in the tumor bearers, where lipoprotein metabolism has been shown to be disturbed, the cholesterol diet caused a substantial increase in the low- and very-low density regions of both blood and ascites plasma lipoproteins. The cholesterol-rich diet also increased the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio and lipid structural order (decreased fluidity) in GRSL ascites cell membranes, but not in the splenic GRSL cell membranes.

To determine the role of reactive intermediate generation in salicylate-induced nephrotoxicity, male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with piperonyl butoxide, phenobarbital, or Aroclor prior to the administration of 500 mg/kg [14C]salicylate. In the kidneys of rats pretreated with only corn oil, mitochondrial macromolecules contained 57% of the total covalently bound radioactivity while in the livers of these same animals, microsomes contained most (52%) of the bound radioactivity. Pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide, an inhibitor of mixed function oxidase activity, decreased (a) salicylate-induced nephrotoxicity; (b) the covalent binding of [14C]salicylate equivalents to renal mitochondria; and (c) the formation of the 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenoic acid metabolites of salicylate. Pretreatment with phenobarbital and Aroclor, inducers of hepatic P-450, on the other hand, had no effect on salicylate-induced nephrotoxicity nor on the covalent binding of [14C]salicylate equivalents to renal mitochondria.

Livers were removed, homogenized 1,2, and 6 hr post-14CHCl3 administration, and glutathione (GSH) content, irreversible binding of 14CHCl3-derived radiolabel, and phospholipid composition were determined. The combination of 2-HX + CHCl3 reduced GSH content to 21% of control (CO + CO) 1 hr after CHCl3 administration. No significant rebound of GSH was observed 24 hr post-CHCl3 administration. In contrast, GSH was not altered by administration of CHCl3 to CO-pretreated rats. Although 14CHCl3-derived radiolabel was irreversibly bound to hepatic macromolecules of both CO- and 2-HX-pretreated rats, total irreversibly bound 14C was significantly enhanced in 2-HX-pretreated rats at all time points. The latter observation was consistent with the decrease in GSH of 2-HX-pretreated rats. Total 14C binding in 2-HX-pretreated rats reached a plateau 2 hr post-14CHCl3 administration and was distributed 52% in protein, 41% in lipid, and 7% in acid soluble fractions 6 hr post-14CHCl3 administration. 2-HX enhanced 14C binding to protein and lipid at each time point. Radiolabel was not detected in neutral lipids of control or 2-hexanone-treated animals, but was enhanced 33-fold in phospholipids of 2-hexanone-treated animals. Phospholipid fatty acid methyl ester derivatives did not contain 14C indicating the radiolabel was most likely associated with phospholipid polar head groups. Two dimensional thin layer chromatographic analysis of phospholipid from treated animals demonstrated that 87% of the total radiolabel was associated with a specific phospholipid (14C-PL) which had a 1:1 molar ratio of phosphate to 14C. The latter indicates that the 14C-PL was a monophospholipid derivative of 14CHCl3 reactive intermediate, generally thought to be phosgene. Concurrent decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine content from 23% of total phospholipid to 7%, accumulation of 14C-PL to 2.6% of total phospholipid, and increase in lysophosphatidylethanolamine from 1 to 7% of total phospholipid during 2-hexanone + 14CHCl3 treatment indicated that the amine moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine polar head groups was the probable target of phosgene-lipid interaction, and that a degradative pathway existed which removed the abnormal phospholipid from hepatic membranes.

Fecal BP excretion was increased 13 times (to 6% of the dose) when 5% wheat brain was used in place of Alphacel and 4.5 times when a commercial diet was used. This suggests that bran adsorbed or sequestered the BP. Water content of the large-intestine contents was increased when the brain diet was fed. Both these factors could affect mucosal exposure to BP. For 3MC, fecal excretion of unchanged hydrocarbon was 14 times greater than for BP under similar conditions.

856576,"Inhibition by CO of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation was studied in hepatic microsomes from rats pretreated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, from animals treated with vehicle (saline or corn oil, respectively), and in a reconstituted microsomal cytochrome P-448 system prepared from rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. In all preparations the hydroxylation was inhibited by CO, and this inhibition was most effectively reversed by irradiation with monochromatic light of 450 nm wavelength. These observations provide direct evidence that the oxygen-activating component of all the examined benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase systems is a P-450-type heme protein. The only striking difference observed in these systems was the low CO sensitivity of the benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase reaction in microsomes from animals treated with 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at CO/O2 ratios of 9--12, rather than at 1--2, which is the usual range for P-450-linked mixed-function oxidase reactions. In contrast, the reconstituted benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase system, with purified cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats, exhibited a considerably higher sensitivity towards CO (CO/O2 ratio approximately 1), well within the range for mixed-function oxidase reactions. It is concluded that the observed diminished CO sensitivity of microsomal benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase in 3-methylcholanthrene- or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-treated rats results from alterations in the composition and/or structural organization of the microenvironment of cytochrome P-448 in the endoplasmic reticulum in response to the inducing action of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and related agents, and is not related to changes in the heme protein P-448 per se.

A second development in the same direction as the first, using toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (6+3+1) or benzene-acetic acid (9+1), separated the mycotoxins. Satisfactory separation was achieved for commercial oils spiked with sterigmatocystin, zearalenone, ochratoxins A, B, and C, and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2. This technique permits detection of 5 ppb aflatoxin B1 in corn.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D000348', 'D010367', 'D002855', 'D008055', 'D009183', 'D009793', 'D009821', 'D012997', 'D013025', 'D013241', 'D003313', 'D015025']","['Aflatoxins', 'Arachis', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Lipids', 'Mycotoxins', 'Ochratoxins', 'Oils', 'Solvents', 'Soybeans', 'Sterigmatocystin', 'Zea mays', 'Zearalenone']",A convenient thin layer chromatographic cleanup procedure for screening several mycotoxins in oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1170165,1975
6071689,"Label claims of special margarines offer little information about constituent fatty acids. Nine brands were analyzed with lipoxidase for the cis-methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids which are present in unhydrogenated vegetable oils. Although four of these products were advertised as being made from corn oil or containing corn oil, they differed greatly in fatty acid composition. The claim of ""polyunsaturates"" did not identify those margarines highest in the cis-methylene-interrupted fatty acids. It is noted that regulations are being proposed to set a minimum level for these poly-unsaturated fatty acids in special margarines.",Canadian Medical Association journal,"['D002849', 'D005227', 'D005504', 'D005513', 'D008383', 'D014481', 'D014486']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Inspection', 'Margarine', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",Variation in polyunsaturates of special margarines.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6071689,1967
