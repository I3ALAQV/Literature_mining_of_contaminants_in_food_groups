35741918,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in germs and germ oil is posing a serious threat to food and feed security. However, the transformation pathway, the distribution of DON, and its degradation products in edible oil refining have not yet been reported in detail. In this work, we systematically explored the variation of DON in maize germ oil during refining and demonstrated that the DON in germ oil can be effectively removed by refining, during which a part of DON was transferred to the wastes, and another section of DON was degraded during degumming and alkali refining. Moreover, the DON degradation product was identified to be norDON B by using the ultraviolet absorption spectrum, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, and the degradation product was found to be distributed in waste products during oil refining. This study provides a scientific basis and useful reference for the production of non-mycotoxins edible oil by traditional refining.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Identification of Deoxynivalenol and Degradation Products during Maize Germ Oil Refining Process.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35741918,2022
34287657,"Zearalenone (ZEN), an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several species of Fusarium fungi, is a common contaminant of cereal-based food worldwide. Due to frequent occurrences associated with high levels of ZEN, maize oil is a particular source of exposure. Although a European maximum level for ZEN in maize oil exists according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2007 along with a newly developed international standard method for analysis, certified reference materials (CRM) are still not available. To overcome this lack, the first CRM for the determination of ZEN in contaminated maize germ oil (ERM®-BC715) was developed in the frame of a European Reference Materials (ERM®) project according to the requirements of ISO Guide 35. The whole process of CRM development including preparation, homogeneity and stability studies, and value assignment is presented. The assignment of the certified mass fraction was based upon an in-house study using high-performance liquid chromatography isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, to support the in-house certification study, an interlaboratory comparison study was conducted with 13 expert laboratories using different analytical methods.

25709066,"Established maximum levels for the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) in edible oil require monitoring by reliable analytical methods. Therefore, an automated SPE-HPLC online system based on dynamic covalent hydrazine chemistry has been developed. The SPE step comprises a reversible hydrazone formation by ZEN and a hydrazine moiety covalently attached to a solid phase. Seven hydrazine materials with different properties regarding the resin backbone, pore size, particle size, specific surface area, and loading have been evaluated. As a result, a hydrazine-functionalized silica gel was chosen. The final automated online method was validated and applied to the analysis of three maize germ oil samples including a provisionally certified reference material. Important performance criteria for the recovery (70-120 %) and precision (RSDr <25 %) as set by the Commission Regulation EC 401/2006 were fulfilled: The mean recovery was 78 % and RSDr did not exceed 8 %. The results of the SPE-HPLC online method were further compared to results obtained by liquid-liquid extraction with stable isotope dilution analysis LC-MS/MS and found to be in good agreement. The developed SPE-HPLC online system with fluorescence detection allows a reliable, accurate, and sensitive quantification (limit of quantification, 30 μg/kg) of ZEN in edible oils while significantly reducing the workload. To our knowledge, this is the first report on an automated SPE-HPLC method based on a covalent SPE approach.

16454902,"Due to their heterogeneous structure and variability in form, individual corn (Zea mays L.) kernels present an optical challenge for nondestructive spectroscopic determination of their chemical composition. Increasing demand in agricultural science for knowledge of specific traits in kernels is driving the need to find high-throughput methods of examination. In this study macroscopic near-infrared (NIR) reflectance hyperspectral imaging was used to measure small sets of kernels in the spectroscopic range of 950 nm to 1700 nm. Image analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to determine kernel germ from endosperm regions as well as to define individual kernels as objects out of sets of kernels. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to predict oil or oleic acid concentrations derived from germ or full kernel spectra. The relative precision of the minimum cross-validated root mean square error (RMSECV) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for oil and oleic acid concentration were compared for two sets of two hundred kernels. An optimal statistical prediction method was determined using a limited set of wavelengths selected by a genetic algorithm. Given these parameters, oil content was predicted with an RMSEP of 0.7% and oleic acid content with an RMSEP of 14% for a given corn kernel.",Applied spectroscopy,"['D000383', 'D000465', 'D003314', 'D005504', 'D015999', 'D019301', 'D012639', 'D013055', 'D003313']","['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Corn Oil', 'Food Analysis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oleic Acid', 'Seeds', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Zea mays']",Prediction of oil and oleic acid concentrations in individual corn (Zea mays L.) kernels using near-infrared reflectance hyperspectral imaging and multivariate analysis.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16454902,2006
10099404,"The tools of plant biotechnology that have been developed to improve agronomic traits are now being applied to generate recombinant protein products for the food, feed, and pharmaceutical industry. This study addresses several processing and protein recovery issues that are relevant to utilizing transgenic corn as a protein production system. The gus gene coding for beta-glucuronidase (rGUS) was stably integrated and expressed over four generations. The accumulation level of rGUS reached 0.4% of total extractable protein. Within the kernel, rGUS was preferentially accumulated in the germ even though a constitutive ubiquitin promoter was used to direct gus expression. Fourth-generation transgenic seed was used to investigate the effect of seed processing on the activity and the recovery of rGUS. Transgenic seed containing rGUS could be stored at an ambient temperature for up to two weeks and for at least three months at 10 degrees C without a significant loss of enzyme activity. rGUS exposed to dry heat was more stable in ground than in whole kernels. The enzyme stability was correlated with the moisture loss of the samples during the heating. Transgenic seed was dry-milled, fractionated, and hexane extracted to produce full-fat and defatted germ fractions. The results of the aqueous extraction of rGUS from ground kernels, full-fat germ, and defatted-germ samples revealed that approximately 10 times more rGUS per gram of solids could be extracted from the ground full-fat germ and defatted-germ than from the kernel samples. The extraction of corn oil from ground germ with hot hexane (60 degrees C) did not affect the extractable rGUS activity. rGUS was purified from ground kernels and full-fat germ extracts by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography. Similar purity and yield of rGUS were obtained from both extracts. Biochemical properties of rGUS purified from transgenic corn seed were similar to those of E. coli GUS.",Biotechnology and bioengineering,"['D000821', 'D004795', 'D004926', 'D005523', 'D005966', 'D030821', 'D011994', 'D012639', 'D003313']","['Animal Feed', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli', 'Food Supply', 'Glucuronidase', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Seeds', 'Zea mays']",Processing of transgenic corn seed and its effect on the recovery of recombinant beta-glucuronidase.,"[None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000201']","[None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10099404,1999
9328527,"The fate of three Fusarium mycotoxins, nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN), all common contaminants in New Zealand-grown maize, has been measured in fractions of maize after passage through a commercial wet-milling plant. Distribution of the three toxins follows a pattern reasonably expected from their physical solubility characteristics. The highly water-soluble mycotoxins, NIV and DON, were found at high concentrations (up to 8.8 mg/kg) in concentrated steep liquor (CSL) fractions, but at low levels (less than 0.3 mg/kg) in the solid (germ, fibre and gluten) fractions. The converse was true for ZEN, which is relatively insoluble in water. For ZEN, the maximum concentration found in CSL was 0.6 mg/kg compared with 2.2-4.8 mg/kg in germ, fibre and gluten fractions. Accordingly, an animal food byproduct composed mainly of pressed fibre and concentrated steep liquor was usually found to contain concentrations of all three mycotoxins above those existing in the input maize. A single sample of corn oil recovered during the study also had a high concentration (4.6 mg/kg) of ZEN. The analytical clean-up method used converts all trichothecenes present to parent alcohols, therefore results are indicative of total trichothecene content.
